          <h4>Expected behavior</h4>
<p>I expect the application to show a message prompt that reads "data connection turned off" or rather, it should open the selected browser, then a message in the browser notifies you of the turned off data connection.</p>
<p>Opening the page in the browser should be a function that is set in motion when the intended browser opens, such that the error of not having the data turned on would be displayed as a message by the browser when it opens. And not the application crashing before the browser even opens.</p>
<h4>Actual behavior</h4>
<p>The application crashes when the "open in the browser" button is clicked with the phone's data connection turned off.</p>
<h4>How to reproduce</h4>
<ul>
<li>download the app from fdroid store</li>
<li>Turn off data connections</li>
<li>launch app and allow permissions if prompted</li>
<li>Click on the three dots at the top right corner of the display and the app crashes. However, the dialog box that allows for the selection of a browser pops up when the data connection is turned on.</li>
</ul>
