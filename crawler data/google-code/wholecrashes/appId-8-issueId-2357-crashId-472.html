          <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am not sure, whether this is the right forum for my question. Maybe you can point me in the right direction, if it is not.</p>
<p>I have a Google-free phone and use MicroG together with openbmap and nominatim location backend instead of google play services. As I have found out, Nominatim doesn't seem to work anymore due to Api changes.</p>
<p>My problem is that whenever I tap on an address of one of my contacts in the Android Contacts App in order to locate the address in OsmAnd, the address is not found in OsmAnd. I just get an error message "Address not found".</p>
<p>I was wondering, whether this has to do with the MicroG/UnifiedNLP setup (e.g. Nominatim not working) or whether this must be a bug within OsmAnd.</p>
<p>Does it work for you to locate an address in Osmand from within the contacts app? If it works for you, what is your setup?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
