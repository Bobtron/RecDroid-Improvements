          <p>Hi,<br>
I hope I am right here to contact you.<br>
I flashed to lineageOS for microg.<br>
Everything works fine but one app, "Anymote", doesn't work. It crashes right from the start - "No billing permission, this build is broken".<br>
Is there anything I can do or adjust? Can any1 please try it on his phone :-) ?<br>
I have a Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x, LOS 15.1, the build from lineage.microg.org, 20180703<br>
I tried older versions of "Anymote", but none worked. With MIUI and Play Services, it worked fine.<br>
Thank you for your help!<br>
Monk</p>
