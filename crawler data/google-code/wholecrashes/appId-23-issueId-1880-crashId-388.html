          <p>I use a hammerhead (Nexus 5) device with OmniROM 6.0.1. I tried it on CopperheadOS as well and it did't work either.</p>
<p>Since I tried Mozillas backend (crashes) and the openbmap one from F-Droid and both fail to get a location fix I guess the problem should be in the middleware....</p>
<p>I cloudln't try locale backends yet.</p>
