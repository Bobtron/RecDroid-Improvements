          <p>The very useful feature that was tracked in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="14626412" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/issues/40" href="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/issues/40">#40</a> and is available since version 1.7 is sadly not consistent in every view.</p>
<p>My device is set to German and RedReader to English, which works most of the time, but sadly not always.</p>
<p>Sometimes some of the the dialogs and menus are seemingly randomly displayed in German. I'm suspecting that it might be related to using mutliple accounts and switching between them, but I have not done enough structured testing to be certain about that.</p>
