          <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I use a somewhat hardened sshd config, in which I have the following:<br>
Ciphers aes256-ctr<br>
MACs hmac-sha2-512, hmac-sha2-256<br>
KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</p>
<p>This apparently prevents MercurySSH from connecting, I find a "ERROR:Â algorithm negotiation fail" in the logs.</p>
<p>I haven't digged in the code, but I think we should encourage strong crypto for SSH (in general), so it might be a good idea to make sure strong ciphers etc. don't break Mercury.</p>
<p>Thanks for a cool app otherwise!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
