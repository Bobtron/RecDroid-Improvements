          <p>I love that the release script waits for remote travis tests to execute before pushing. I don't love having to leave my terminal open for 10+ minutes for the process to finish...</p>
<p>I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscribe a server to <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent">push webhooks</a> for the repo</li>
<li>Whenever a new tag is pushed (should enforce gpg signed tags for releases), check it out, wait for the travis build to finish, and do the release from there</li>
<li>Post a message to slack with success/failure</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there should still be an option to do the whole thing locally, but ideally the cutoff point is after you validate the build on your device and the rest can be done by infra.</p>
<p>Downside: I don't like that the apk that gets pushed is different that the one I built locally. I wonder if anybody has gotten deterministic builds for Android working... <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/lildebi/wiki/Deterministic-Builds">Script to compare builds</a>. <a href="https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Verification_Server" rel="nofollow">This also seems cool</a></p>
