          <p>Would be really awesome to be able to do this. Alternatively, it would be quicker and easier to implement <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="59009590" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/issues/205" href="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/issues/205">#205</a> for the same purpose. Thanks so much for RedReader!</p>
