          <p>I needed to uninstall microG and go back to having Google Play Services because I couldn't log into my Love Live! School Idol Festival account (due to Google Play Games not working on microG). So i uninstalled the microG Core and Framework, as well as the fakegapps xposed module. (sorry if i'm using the wrong names, i can't really check right now). Rebooted etc and tried to reinstall Google play services, but now it kept giving me an "unfortunately, google play services has stopped" error. I tried to look it up but no solution helped me at all. I tried to reinstall the google play services framework as well, but the situation just worsened. Now my phone is pretty much unusable. Awfully slow and keeps giving me an error that says that the framework has stopped.</p>
<p>I really need my phone. It's all i have right now, since i can't access my computer very often. Why is there no guide on how to uninstall microG properly and reinstall GPS anywhere...? Anyway, I really need help as soon as possible. Please help...</p>
