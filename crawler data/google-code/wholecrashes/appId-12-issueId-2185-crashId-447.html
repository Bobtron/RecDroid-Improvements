          <p>This might be an awful idea. But what about having the right fragment always the last opened post, and the left being navigation, either the main view, or a subreddit. The back button would bring the left up from a subreddit to the main page, back again would then close the post.</p>
<p>Also pinging <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="13030492" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/issues/27" href="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/issues/27">#27</a>, I would love the internal browser to be a fragment.</p>
