          <p>On my device (OnePlus One running CyanogenMod 12, never had GApps), the following tests fail:</p>
<ul>
<li>System supports location provider</li>
<li>UnifiedNLP has known location</li>
<li>UnifiedNLP provides location updates</li>
</ul>
<p>However, both SatStat and Navit receive location updates from UnifiedNLP.</p>
<p>Tested with <code>NetworkLocation-debug.apk</code> built locally from <a class="commit-link" href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/commit/bcf1cff35ef8c111c8c0570ccb803ec3edd44eed"><tt>bcf1cff</tt></a> and installed as a regular user app, rebooted after install.</p>
