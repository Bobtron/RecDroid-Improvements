          <p>Hello,<br>
After some extensive googling it seems that you should be able to write to external SD card (which is pretty much a must if you plan on torrenting on an android device).</p>
<p>The only thing is your destination folder should be <code>/&lt;externalsd&gt;/Android/data/com.biglybt.android.client</code>.<br>
On that folder you should have write support.</p>
<p>I've installed BiglyBT on an Nvidia Shield TV, tried downloading to the above folder on a NAS share (mounted by the Shield it self - that is <code>/storage/.../Android/data/com.biglybt.android.client</code>), but keep getting permission errors on the above folder and can't get it to work.</p>
