          <p>When I try to withdraw from my 3.1.1 wallet on Android 5.1, I get this error message:<br>
org.bitcoinj.crypto.KeyCrypterException:Could not decrypt bytes</p>
<p>If possible, I would like to export my private keys, import them into a 64-bit Core wallet on Windows and send the coins from there.</p>
