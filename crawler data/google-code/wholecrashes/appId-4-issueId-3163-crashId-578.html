          <p>At the moment the only way to collapse user's comment on GH is by using <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> tag as described in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="156548578" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues/166" href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues/166">dear-github/dear-github#166</a>.</p>
<p>Looks like this one isn't rendered properly in ForkHub (it just displays the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> and then everything else below, unfolded. Android's Chrome seems to parse that ok (when opening GH directly).</p>
<p>This request is to fix/implement this, if possible. That would make it way easier to e.g. analyze issues using Forkhub, where people just dump the whole log from e.g. NPM, like <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa/issues/692">here</a>.</p>
<p>Could you please take a look at this? I could even take a stab at it, if that's doesn't require rewriting half of the app and if you could provide me with some directions (I don't have any real Android programming experience, but I know the basics) :)</p>
