          <p>Dear Dev's , thanks for the great work and loving the launcher, however when I start to slide the Google Now Page open, there is a slight hiccup as the page starts to slide open. I've noticed if I slide open the page and select the upcoming events icon at the bottom of the page the hiccup stops and the page slides open and closed as smooth as silk. When I change back to the regular view the slight roughness starts again. The phone I'm using is an LG V20. Also the launcher does crash 3 to 4 times a day and I have to restart launcher from lawn chair settings. Sometimes this helps and sometimes not. Thanks again for the great work..</p>
