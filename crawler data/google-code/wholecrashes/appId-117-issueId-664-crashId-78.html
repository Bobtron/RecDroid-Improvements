<ul>
<li>could have a separate adventuresmith-data GitHub repository that we look up at runtime. Would want to tag/branch the repo, and have a way for user to select which tag to use (if they don't want default tag selected for that app release).</li>
<li>could do tags, or maybe stable/beta branches. branches (or wild-card tags) would be nice for pushing out fixes/new-generators automatically. tags would be good for stability/consistency (and not having to worry about app-version related schema changes).</li>
<li>Android has Sync Adapter framework: <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/sync-adapters/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/training/sync-adapters/index.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>github api: <a href="https://github.com/rejasupotaro/octodroid">https://github.com/rejasupotaro/octodroid</a></p>
<p>seems like app could support</p>
<ul>
<li>a community-driven public repo (hosted on github), separate from the app's repo. App could use github API to discover the data within the repo</li>
<li>private generator repos -- specific to each user? on gdrive? local to phone?</li>
</ul>
<p>if did google drive:</p>
<p>under their root Drive dir, user must create 'Adventuresmith' directory</p>
<ul>
<li>subdirs under 'Adventuresmith' become different 'profiles' selectable in left nav<br>
** that way, could have 'beta' and 'stable' versions. or, user could create multiple 'playlist'-like groupings</li>
<li>I could create a share they stick under their 'Adventuresmith' folder for community-created content (and, this would also be backed by a github repo)</li>
<li>/Adventuresmith////<br>
** subdir1 -- 'profiles'<br>
** subdir2 -- collections<br>
** subdir3..subdir4 -- groups</li>
<li>collection &amp; group hierarchy reflected in left-nav</li>
<li>how to do icons?</li>
</ul>
