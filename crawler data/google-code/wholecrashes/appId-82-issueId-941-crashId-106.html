          <p>As work to make the app more dynamic, we should be able to control as much as we can server side. There isn't really a good/standard way to do this, so this will be a cool opportunity to build our own infra.</p>
<hr>
<h2>My Idea</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use GitHub pages to host json config filese</li>
<li>The app can ship with the set of configs available at build time, and then download/update them as they change (like how <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="151234314" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/issues/710" href="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/pull/710">#710</a> was done)</li>
<li>The TBA server can track the last "config update" time via a GitHub webhook (we subscribe to it and automatically update the sitevar)</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, most features can have "kill switches" to stop things that break or to provide a server-side switch to turn new things on.</p>
