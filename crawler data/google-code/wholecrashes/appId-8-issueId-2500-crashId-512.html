          <p>For the past few month, more and more apps has started to crash after being updated. MicroG seams to have started loosing it's compatibility with later versions of GMS and apps that are updated for these newer versions starts to crash one by one.  The latest example is Shazam, which until now has been working fine. According to the logcat, it seams to be related to some firebase stuff.</p>
