          <p>If I have Squeezer open and continually use the UI, everything works fine.<br>
However, if I switch to another app on my tablet like GMail for a period of time and switch back, Squeezer will hang trying to re-connect to the Squeezebox server.</p>
<p>BTW - I cloned this repo onto my machine to try to Debug the issue myself. But there's a ton of dependencies missing from this repo and a ton of errors trying to get this compiling in Android studio.</p>
<p>I'd love to be able to contribute a fix.</p>
