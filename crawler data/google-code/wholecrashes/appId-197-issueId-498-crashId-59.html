          <p>Maintaining over 20+ styles is a burden and creates boilerplate style files... Plus there are styles that are mainly under-used.<br>
Suggesting a revamp of the theme selection with :</p>
<ul>
<li>custom primary and accent color selection (primaryDark computed automatically) -&gt; color picker?</li>
<li>drawer image selection</li>
</ul>
<p>With the introduction of Night mode <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="159794656" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/herbeth1u/VNDB-Android/issues/52" href="https://github.com/herbeth1u/VNDB-Android/issues/52">#52</a>, this would be much more appropriate and easier to maintain.</p>
