          <p>Hi,<br>
I am experiencing some issues with the UnifiedNLP.<br>
My phone is running Lineage 14.1 with gapps (the pico package).</p>
<p>I have followed the tutorial to make unifiedNLP work with Gapps.</p>
<ul>
<li>install UnifiedNLP (GAPPS) package from F-droid</li>
<li>configure backends</li>
<li>install XposedUnifiedNLP (from here <a href="https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.r3w6.xposedunifiednlp" rel="nofollow">https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.r3w6.xposedunifiednlp</a> )</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, in the self check status, I have two "errors":</p>
<ul>
<li>System support location provider<br>
Your system does not support this unifed package<br>
*UnifiedNLP is registered in system<br>
The system did not bind the UnifiedNLP service.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Location backend set up" and "Network based location enabled" are both checked but the it says that Unified has no last known location and No UnifiedNlp location was provided by the system</p>
<p>(I've rebooted the phone multiple times.)</p>
<p>Do you have any clue about my issue?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
