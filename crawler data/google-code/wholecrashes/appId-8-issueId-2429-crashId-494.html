          <p>I'm having issues using Signal with microG.<br>
Problems match those described in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="214362967" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6392" href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6392">signalapp/Signal-Android#6392</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[the problems started when OWS updated the version of GMS used in Signal, so] I assume microG isn't properly reporting that it is API compatible with the updated version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That hypothesis is supported on my device (i9300, Replicant 6.0) by the Signal debug log, which includes:</p>
<pre><code>3593  3610 W GcmRefreshJob: Reregistering GCM...
3593  3610 W GooglePlayServicesUtil: Google Play services out of date.  Requires 9683000 but found 9258259
</code></pre>
<p>MicroG in itself appears to install well. Installed via F-Droid. The self tests are OK.</p>
<p>From a user perspective it seems like the easiest way out of this problem would be if microG reported a higher version. While looking for a solution I saw some comments about other programs complaining about outdated services as well.<br>
Could you make this change? Could I myself work around the issue somehow?</p>
