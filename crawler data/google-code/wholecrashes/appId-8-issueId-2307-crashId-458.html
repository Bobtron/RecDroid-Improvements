          <p>I am trying to develop web push notifications for my webapp. I am new at this, so I made some research. If I understand well, Web Push Notifications are just in the process of getting standardized.</p>
<p>When Chrome started to support it, it was through GCM, then FCM. You had to register to get a Google Developer project, sender id, etc. (<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notifications-on-the-open-web" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notifications-on-the-open-web</a>)<br>
Moving forward, with Chrome 52 you no longer need to do this, there is VAPID, etc. Web Push Protocol is getting standardized.<br>

<p>What is the current state of Web Push Support in microg?</p>
<p>Using CM13, latest microG (0.2.4-81), and Chromium, I can not get web push notifications working. GCM works fine for other apps.</p>
<p>I tried with theese examples:<br>

<p><a href="https://fcm-demo-mtbqzgkaoz.now.sh" rel="nofollow">https://fcm-demo-mtbqzgkaoz.now.sh</a><br>
This site says on the phone:<br>
FirebaseError: Requested entity was not found. (I have seen this at other sites too, so it seems that Chromium is not able to get a Firebase token)</p>
<p>Is the these web push notifications supposed to work with microG?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
