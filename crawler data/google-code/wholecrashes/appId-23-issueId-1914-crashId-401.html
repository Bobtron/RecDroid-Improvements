          <p>OK, so I have noticed that at least an application I used (which relies on Google Services, at least on the Google Maps API for location purposes) refuses to even start since two days ago with an error "Google Services is needed to run this app".</p>
<p>This is coinciding with the Google Maps API being updated. Among other things this update introduces the need to have any request sent to the API propperly signed  with an API key and tied to a billing account. The deadline to start signing all the requests with a valid key was June 16th.</p>
<p>Now, we know that MicroG sings the petitions with a spoofed (or whatever, I don't know the details  tbh) but I doubt that the key tied to any active billing account, so the call gets rejected and the app doesn't start.</p>
<p>Find here the related documentation for this: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/user-guide/" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/user-guide/</a></p>
<p>Also, the fact that some apps stopped working but others still do make me think that either I am horribly wrong about this or that it is dependent on how the app makes these calls or which services they are using (maybe the only ones failing right now are the ones using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/premium/overview" rel="nofollow">Premium API</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, leaving this here hoping it can be helpful. Please move it to the appropiate place if this is not the correct one.</p>
