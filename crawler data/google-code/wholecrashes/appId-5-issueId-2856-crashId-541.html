          <p>I know this was asked before in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="285271665" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/1102" href="https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnchair/issues/1102">#1102</a>, and the answer was "this is not Pixel style", but as you can see in my screenshot the search bar isn't of any use at all if your apps are all visible in a single screen, also if you have a few more it will prevent you from viewing them in a single screen.</p>
