          <h2>Description</h2>
<p>When moving items around using  the talkback actions the launcher will crash. I did send logs in February or so but so far this has not be fixed</p>
<h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
<p>What should happen is this, the launcher should not crash if I let's say move an icon from 1 page to another, or even into a folder.</p>
<h2>Actual Behavior</h2>
<p>The app crashes and the close and send feedback that android brings up shows up.</p>
<h2>Steps to Reproduce</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure launcher  is set to launcheer.</li>
<li>Hit home and find an item you want to move</li>
<li>Bring up the talk back actions menu</li>
<li>Tap move</li>
<li>Tap on the new place you want to move the item to.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is when the crash happens. The items are moved but the app will still crash. It works afterwords but it should not in theory be doing this.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Device: moto z2 force<br>
Android version: 8.0</p>
<p>I've forgotten the latest version of the launcher  but it is what is on the app store. I'm not a part  of the beta program so this is a public release.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
