<td class="d-block comment-body markdown-body  js-comment-body">

          <p>For search queries that deliver results in exactly one category, e.g. a query that contains <code>is:issue</code> it would be handy if the respective category would be selected.</p>
<p>Motivation/Background: With the resolution of <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="285164719" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/1371" href="https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/1371">#1371</a> (thanks a lot, btw!) I can have a handy icon on my Desktop opening a search for the issues I should work on, however I still have to switch to the issues tab. No big deal, but not having to would save a click and make it more elegant.</p>
