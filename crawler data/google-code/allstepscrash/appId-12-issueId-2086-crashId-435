          <p>RedReader aggressively caches images, and crashes occur when a device runs out of storage space.</p>
<p><strong>When the disk fills up, <em>or</em> the app starts and less than 128MB of storage is available:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Delete any cached images</li>
<li>Disable image precaching</li>
<li>Set to delete cached images after 1 hour (or sooner)</li>
<li>Display a message to that effect</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Also:</strong> Display an error message specific to the lack of storage when a download fails.</p>
<p>Other suggestions would be welcome.</p>
