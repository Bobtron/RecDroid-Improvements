          <p>Consider a common scenario:</p>
<p>A user has a blog with 100s of blog posts. She makes some small changes to a draft, or creates a new draft, or updates a published post. Then when she goes back to the post list, we upload the local changes and then download and save to db <em>every single post</em> again (in one gigantic request), because the post list's ETag will have changed, which is obviously horrendously inefficient. In one casual test, this scenario (one small change to a single post) on a blog with 100 fairly long posts uses 250-350 KB of data! Imagine what happens when there are 5x more posts, and the user makes lots of small edits in several different posts!</p>
<p>These should help:</p>
