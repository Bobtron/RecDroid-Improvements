          <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using lineagos with microg on my Galaxy S7.<br>
LineageOS Version is 14.1-2018021-herolte.<br>
MicroG Services Core is 0.2.4-108.<br>
DriveNow Version 4.8.1</p>
<p>DriveNow opens up just fine, geolocation works and cars are displayed. As soon as I select a car from the map the app crashes.</p>
<p>Is this a known issue ? I found several older postings regarding that problem. However this articel suggests that it worked not so long ago: <a href="https://www.androidpit.de/android-ohne-google-wird-jetzt-erheblich-bequemer" rel="nofollow"></a></p>
<p>Cheers !</p>
