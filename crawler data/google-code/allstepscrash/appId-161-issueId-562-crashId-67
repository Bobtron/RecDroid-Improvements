          <p>First I want to thank you for your amazing work.<br>
I just saw the DroidGuard Helper coming up and wanted to give it a try.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S2 (gt-i9100)<br>
cm13.0 nightly20160924<br>
with Xposed</p>
<p>I got the "SafetyNet Helper" app from the PlayStore and started the test, but DroidGuard helper crashed and the test failed.</p>
<p>I saved the log via Catlog, maybe it is helpfull for you.<br>
