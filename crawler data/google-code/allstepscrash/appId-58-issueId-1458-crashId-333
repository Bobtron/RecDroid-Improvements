          <p>This is just a low priority feature suggestion, which I wanted to capture before I completely forget about it (I once mentioned this in issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="254505555" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/JusticeRage/ApkTrack/issues/109" href="https://github.com/JusticeRage/ApkTrack/issues/109">#109</a>: "APKUpdater also displays the original version strings (along a human readable version number), which is very helpful; a feature ApkTrack unfortunately lacks.").</p>
<p>So please consider adding the technical version string after the human readable version number and the technical name for installed APKs in ApkTrack's main window, so the entry for the current ApkTrack 2.1.2 (from F-Droid) would look like this:<br>
<strong>ApkTrack (fr.kwiatkowski.ApkTrack)<br>
2.1.2 (23)<br>
[F-Droid] Last check: XXXX</strong></p>
<p>This would be quite helpful in order to distinguish APK versions, which display the same human readable version, but differ in their technical version string (some software authors only count up the latter on bug fix releases).</p>
<p>Note that solely displaying the technical name (as Application Info does, see screenshot below; but it provides the human readable name in its title bar, when looking at the details of a specific app) may confuse less tech-savvy users, as some APKs do not carry their human readable name in their technical name string.</p>
