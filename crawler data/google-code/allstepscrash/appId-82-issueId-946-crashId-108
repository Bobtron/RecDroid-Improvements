          <p>It'd be very helpful to indicate followed (subscribed + favorited) teams in each match list, along with the match schedule (or estimated schedule <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="151700305" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/issues/723" href="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/issues/723">#723</a>), like TBA web does with its yellow stars and yellow dots:</p>

<p>It needn't use the same visual indicators. Boldifying the team numbers might suffice.</p>
<p>Note: When you get to a team list from a specific team, the app boldifies that team's number. Maybe it should use different visual indicators for that team vs. your followed teams.</p>
<p>Note: Making 6 DB queries per row would be too slow. The app could build a set of all needed team numbers then make a single DB query in the current event, or make a generic DB query for all followed teams in the current event.</p>
