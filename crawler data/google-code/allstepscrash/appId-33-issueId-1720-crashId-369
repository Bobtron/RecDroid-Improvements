<p><strong>How to</strong><br>
Translate those strings in the strings.xml with the exception being the ToS and put them into a folder called values-xy (xy being ISO 639-1 code for your language. List can be obtained here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes</a> ). Once you are done simply create a pull request or mail me your file and we'll check and merge it.</p>
<p><strong>Optional</strong>: Specify your real name or pseudonym in your strings.xml under "translator_name" in order to display credit in Lunarys in app about page.</p>
