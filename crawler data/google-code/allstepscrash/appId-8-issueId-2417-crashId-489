          <p>I'm trying to use Android Pay but it constantly crashes with the following error message. "Android Pay is unavailable. Android Pay isn't available"   I know I pass SafetyNet because I'm able to play Pokemon Go without issue. Is it possible to add in support for Android Pay?</p>
<p>I've taken a logcat during the crash.<br>
