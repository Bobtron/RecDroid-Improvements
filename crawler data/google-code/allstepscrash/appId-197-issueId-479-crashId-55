<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="" disabled class="task-list-item-checkbox"> Searching for VNs which are translated in a specific language is very important and may replace <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="182101772" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/herbeth1u/VNDB-Android/issues/77" href="https://github.com/herbeth1u/VNDB-Android/issues/77">#77</a>. An autocomplete view is not necessary for now, just a spinner will do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the recent update of Pocket MAL showed how VNDBA's current layout is limited and not very native-looking.</p>
<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li class="task-list-item">
<p><input type="checkbox" id="" disabled class="task-list-item-checkbox"> Since this issue is going to add another search option, it would be appropriate to create a right drawer for the search options (also the "Advanced search" button, the repeated search bar and the repeated SEARCH button are very interesting UX-wise and should be integrated as such). Note that the "Advances search" button disappears on scroll. Remove the submit icon (will be in the drawer).</p>

<li class="task-list-item">
<p><input type="checkbox" id="" disabled class="task-list-item-checkbox"> Contact Glodanif to inform him of these changes and suggest to add his name in the About page (because VNDBA is going to be a copy of Pocket MAL at this pace. Oh wait, is it already the case?)</p>
</li>
<li class="task-list-item">
<p><input type="checkbox" id="" disabled class="task-list-item-checkbox"> Also, decrease the font size of the tags which is way too big for a drawer.</p>
</li>
<li class="task-list-item">
<p><input type="checkbox" id="" disabled class="task-list-item-checkbox">  Remove also the floating input lib which is unnecessary and just used here. Just use TextInputLayouts instead.</p>
