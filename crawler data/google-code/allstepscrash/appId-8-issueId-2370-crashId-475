          <p>hi,</p>
<p>i want to stop google from running privileged code on my device. however, i'm ok with running google code if sandboxed. in fact, i need to. i can't have a phone that cannot run hangouts for instance, because i need voip support to be able to work. (i've talked about sandboxed google before: <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="196986612" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/253" href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/253">#253</a> )</p>
<p>i've posted on the hangouts issue (which looks simple enough, apparently a missing SSL provider), but the microG project does not seem to be prioritizing this: <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="125478180" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/72" href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/72">#72</a></p>
<p>microG reimplements the google account. but in my view, the google account can be considered part of the google client apps that i am willing to run (as long as they are sandboxed). if i am using google client apps (gmail, hangouts, etc) i might as well also use google's implementation of their account. in fact, issues with microG's version of the google account might crop up later with client app updates, and using google's code instead is probably safer in this regard.</p>
<p>but for many reasons, microG is doing the right thing in reimplementing the google account; i won't argue this. my position is that not everybody using microG is interested in this functionality.</p>
<p>because of the hangouts issue, that has been open for a year without progress, i'll have to abandon microG unfortunately.</p>
<p>fortunately, google's own account manager seems to work with just one privileged permission. see:<br>

<p>i'd like to install google's account manager, at least for the time being, side by side with microG replacing other google services. but unfortunately i think this is not possible because microG and its implementation of the google account is monolithic, and i suspect both account managers can't coexist in the same device.</p>
<p>is this suspicion true?</p>
<p>i'd suggest breaking app microG core in two apps to separate the account manager and handle this issue. this would also add the benefit of not installing a google account manager (even if free software) for those who don't want any google service.</p>
