          <p>Following the discussion in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="58063967" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/JusticeRage/ApkTrack/issues/8" href="https://github.com/JusticeRage/ApkTrack/issues/8">#8</a>, and the apparent popularity of Raccoon to download APKs, it would be interesting to be able to interact with it automatically - or at least, as automatically as possible.</p>
<p>I've never used this tool however. What kind of input does it accept? Can we feed it a text file containing all the packages to download? If there is, which syntax is accepted?<br>
And if not, should we request this feature to <a class="user-mention" data-hovercard-user-id="452993" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/onyxbits">@onyxbits</a>?</p>
