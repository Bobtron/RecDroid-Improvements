<p>This is a follow-up to <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="218783147" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/232" href="https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/232">#232</a>, as I was told to open another issue.</p>
<p>It seems when you tap on a reaction button, the app always just increments the count by one, and the correct counts are only displayed if you press the back button and open the issue again (reloading doesn't seem to be enough).</p>
<p>Due to GitHub API limitations, this should probably be implemented by re-requesting the reaction counts from after sending the user's reaction, and disabling the reaction buttons and showing some sort of indicator while the request is being processed.</p>
<p>If the user already reacted to an issue in the current session (for simplicity's sake, a session could be as short as until you leave the issue page or exit the app, whichever comes first), then a local prediction can be made, though it may be best to always re-request the reaction counts to make sure.</p>
