          <p>While browsing posts, hitting refresh while offline will display "Connection Error" and clear the posts view. However, re-selecting the current sort in the sorting options menu will re-populate the view with the cached data for the posts. To keep the behavior consistent, refreshing while offline should display the "Connection Error" message but not clear the content of the view.</p>
