          <p>Right now, Remindly uses the system default notification sound for all reminders - see <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="136925517" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/blanyal/Remindly/issues/44" href="https://github.com/blanyal/Remindly/issues/44">#44</a>.</p>
<p>Ability to set a specific notification sound for each reminder would help users to tell reminders from each others.<br>
Especially useful when having one or more repeated reminders.</p>
