          <p>Using IAP force closes the Play Store and the calling app. I have successfully made an IAP with the Play Store and microG in the past, so something may have changed permission-wise that broke it.</p>
<p>Using: Play Store 6.1.12 installed in /system/priv-app<br>
Version: GmsCore Nightly 0.2.0<br>
Tested with: Awesome Pop-Up Video, Battery Shutdown Manager, and Forest</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an app with IAB</li>
<li>Initiate purchase</li>
<li>Play Store pops up and asks for payment method</li>
<li>Click "Buy"</li>
<li>Play Store and calling app force close with UID 10074 security exception. UID 10074 on my device is com.android.vending/Play Store according to /data/system/packages.list</li>
</ol>
