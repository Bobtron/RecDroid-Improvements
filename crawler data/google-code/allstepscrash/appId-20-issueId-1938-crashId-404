          <p>I was syncing with one account, then I loaded a different configuration file to sync with a different account. On the Taskwarrior end of that account, I uploaded about 40 tasks, only one of them new for this time around.</p>
<p>The first time I synced Mirakel using the new sync configuration file, I got this error message:<br>
<code>Mirakel: Finish sync Could not find common ancestor. This means something is out of sync with the server and you have to wipe the mirakel data. Sorry</code></p>
<p>It doesn't say <em>how</em> I should go about wiping the mirakel data...</p>
