          <p>Could you please add the possibility to read an xml from the system partition (only on the first run of microG GmsCore) with a default configuration of some options?</p>
<p>For example with the possibility to enable by default "Google Device Registration".<br>
Because with this disabled Google Play Store give error RH-01.</p>
