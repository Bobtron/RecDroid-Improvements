# Crawler code by John
Helpful crawler code that John, the original creator of Recdroid, gave me. Use it to crawl for bug reports.

This folder also contains sub folders which contain many html pages. These html pages are the result of parsing google-code archive for possible bug reports. Use them as test cases for sample bug reports, or go through them to find viable apps.
