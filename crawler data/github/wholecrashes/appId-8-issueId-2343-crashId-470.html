          <p>There is a game I'm trying to play while using microg called Love Live! School Idol Festival.  One thing to note was in order to play this game I had to use rootcloak for it to load since it isn't supported on rooted devices.  Once the game finished downloading the extra data it needed it restarted and told me "You cannot make in-app purchases with the current Google Play account."  Then the game just crashes.</p>
