          <p>This might seem weird in a world of binge-watching, Netflix, YouTube, and BitTorrent, but some people are still dependent on good old TV channels and their whims. This means you can’t always watch a programme starting at episode 1 of season 1.</p>
<p>Recently we started watching <i>Doctor Who</i> again, but we just started where the TV broadcaster was at the time: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2317659/" rel="nofollow">episode 2 of season 7</a>, <i>Dinosaurs on a Spaceship</i>.</p>
<p>Currently DroidShows is telling me my next episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> will be 1x01. Worse still even when I go into the series it will say my next episode of Season 7 is 1x01. When I watch the next episode next week, I have to remember what season I am in because I DroidShows doesn’t focus my current season for me (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="130125262" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/ltGuillaume/DroidShows/issues/11" href="https://github.com/ltGuillaume/DroidShows/issues/11">#11</a>).</p>
<p>I can’t imagine I am the only person alive who isn’t always able to start at 1x01.</p>
<p>The solution seems simple to me: instead of displaying the absolute first unseen episode of a series and season, display the first unseen episode after the last seen one.</p>
<p>I could go and manually mark everything as seen, but then I would lose any reliable tracking statistics. I really like how DroidShows keeps track of <strong>when</strong> I watched an episode.</p>
