<p>Hey. So I just had this happen and it's probably a rather rare occurrence of a bug. I was creating an Issue on a Repo of mine and during that the bus I'm riding drove into an area where the mobile connection always breaks down. It so happened that I clicked the Assignee button and just clicked the check mark since nothing load when the app crashed.</p>
<p>I'll try to reproduce it again today on my ride back home and let you know more.</p>
