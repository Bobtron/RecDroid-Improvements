          <p>SevereWeather App "Unwetter" from Michael Diener opens and centers the screen on the wrong Position. If i move the screen right down it shows my GPS marker on the Google map. With Googles gms , the marker was always in the center of the screen after App open without manually moving right down.</p>
<p>Further difference. When using microg gms instead of Googles gms, i cannot click coloured tiles of the map (these should display weather warnings Form DWD if the Tile is coloured , a Warning is present and can be clicked. ).</p>
<p>Sometimes i can work around the microg bug by zooming a little bit in and out or moving the map so the spot of my location dies no longer fit in the screen center.</p>
<p>Here is some logcat. Rarely App crashes, so i only geht this error on crash. Above symptoms always occur. Cm13 on Lg h815. Nightly 29.05.2016, fakesig and xposed 85 arm64.</p>

<p>All those problems do not occur when using Google gms.</p>
