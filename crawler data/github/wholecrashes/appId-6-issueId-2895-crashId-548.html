          <p><strong>Shuttle version:</strong></p>
<p>v2.0.3</p>
<p><strong>Device, OS:</strong></p>
<p>Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 MTK | Android 6.0 (2017-12-05)</p>
<p><strong>Description of bug:</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35920140/35507955-a67b0cdc-0542-11e8-85c5-5d57d24b0404.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35920140/35507955-a67b0cdc-0542-11e8-85c5-5d57d24b0404.png" alt="2018-01-29 19 09 22" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>When I try to set the Artist artwork, I am presented with an error message;<br>
Enable Documents in Settings &gt; Installed apps first<br>
which, of course, means that I cannot set the artwork.</p>
<p>I am wondering where the message is coming from, either Shuttle+ or the OS. It is difficult to resolve as neither Shuttle+ nor the OS have a setting of 'Enable Documents' within Installed apps, at least that I could find.<br>
At least if I know what process is spawning this message, it may lead to a clue as to how to resolve it.</p>
<p>Since I last had to update/add any artwork, both Shuttle+ and Phone have had updates. All previous artwork was manually added.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select Artist from Artist list.</li>
<li>Tap on vertical ellipsis to open menu and select "Choose artwork".</li>
<li>Tap "Gallery".</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expected outcome:</strong></p>
<p>Previously Shuttle+ would have you navigate through storage to a folder containing artwork, then the required picture could be selected by name.</p>
<p><strong>Observations/Actual Result:</strong></p>
<p>Pop-up error message "Enable Documents in Settings &gt; Installed apps first"</p>
