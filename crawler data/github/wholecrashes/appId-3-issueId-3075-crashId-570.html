<p>Details of release page has two buttons, "Cancel" and "OK" that serve no purpose other than to confuse user, as both close the view (see <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="315174059" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/1742" href="https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/1742#issuecomment-382195319">#1742 (comment)</a>). There should be only one with text clearly communicating the button closes the view.</p>
<p>This is a follow-up to <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="315174059" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/1742" href="https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/1742">#1742</a>, which got closed labelled as "question", I understand that you wanted a separate issue for the bug report then.</p>
