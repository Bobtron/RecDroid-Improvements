          <p>Device: Nexus 5x<br>
ROM: Lineage 15.1 for microg (latest build)<br>
App: Threema 3.41 (Webshop-Version)</p>
<p>Switched over from <em>LOS 14.1 for microg</em> to <em>LOS 15.1 for microg</em> yesterday. Push via microg GCM worked like a charm for Threema (3.41) on LOS 14.1, it doesn't on LOS 15.1.<br>
On LOS 15.1 the logs are showing a timeout when Threema is trying to register for GCM (java.io.IOException: TIMEOUT).</p>
<p>See the attached logs for details. The error messages seem to be the same in case of the initial registration intent and when hitting the "Reset Push Token" button in Threema config options.</p>
<p>This is a newly installed LOS 15.1, before installation I did a full wipe. Threema (Threema Webshop APK-Version) was installed from SDCARD.</p>

<p>I`ve seen <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="273642369" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/439" href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/439">#439</a> and <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="304566172" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/502" href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/502">#502</a> but don't think this is a duplicate. The  other reports are describing different phenomena, this is meant as a specific report for Threema on LOS 15.1.</p>
