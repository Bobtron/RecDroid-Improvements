          <p>I'm running Android 7.1.1 with microG core 0.2.4.79 built from source and baked directly into my ROM. The self check does not yield any error and I tested the GCM cloud with Push Notification Tester. It all seems to run fine as long as the phone stays active, however whenever doze kicks in notifications (specifically from WhatsApp) get delayed. BTW I also disabled battery optimization for microG. Whenever I would go into microG settings and check the connection timer it would always be less than an hour.<br>
I did not know how to record a helpful logcat, so I may only submit a log from almost the whole day. Hope it helps: <a href="http://pastebin.com/DBd2XzWT" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/DBd2XzWT</a></p>
<p>Interestingly from 1pm to 8 pm there's no message from microG in the log at all.</p>
