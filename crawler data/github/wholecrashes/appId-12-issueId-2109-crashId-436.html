          <p>When you change your password RedReader gives this generic error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parse Error<br>
Reddit sent some data I couldn't understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might be a good Idea to indicate that there was an authentication problem when someone changes their password. It Took me a while to figure out what was actually going on.</p>
