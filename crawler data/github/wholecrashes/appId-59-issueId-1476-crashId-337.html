          <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I get this error "Could not load exchange rates" a few months after installing the wallet. Can't see the value of my wallet anymore. This happened to me twice. Once with an earlier version and again with version 3.0.0. Not sure where this call is made in the code but if I did know I may be able to figure it out on my own. I have a few skills necessary just not familiar with this project.</p>
