          <p>Hello mar-v-in,<br>
i would really like to use the whole MicroG stuff but I have LineageOS (Android Nougat) on my mobile devices. I'm a bit suspicious of "LineageOS bundled with microG" and would like to stick to the official LineageOS versions. Apart from that "LineageOS bundled with microG" doesn't support my devices at this time.</p>
<p>Today I've read that after long long waiting time Xposed Framework for Android Nougat was finally released: <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/official-xposed-framework-android-nougat/" rel="nofollow">https://www.xda-developers.com/official-xposed-framework-android-nougat/</a></p>
<p>Does that mean that MicroG can be used on "stock" LineageOS now? Has anyone testet if FakeGapps run on Nougat now? <a href="http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.thermatk.android.xf.fakegapps" rel="nofollow">http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.thermatk.android.xf.fakegapps</a></p>
<p>I'm an android noob and don't want to crash my devices while testing things like that. But I'd really like to see a step by step guide for installing MicroG on current LineageOS versions, if it is possible now.</p>
