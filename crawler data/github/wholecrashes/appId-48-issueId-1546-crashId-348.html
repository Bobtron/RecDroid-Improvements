          <p>hello, the api that you provide was working perfectly and now the app shows the image/video. But after I click on download button, the app got forced closed..<br>
here is the log in AS<br>
android.os.FileUriExposedException: file:///storage/emulated/0/InstaDownloader/IMG_22222222.jpg exposed beyond app through Intent.getData().</p>
<p>here is the line that get an error in InstaDownloader.Java class<br>
<code>inContext.startActivity(i);</code></p>
<p>Can you tell me why and how to fix this?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
