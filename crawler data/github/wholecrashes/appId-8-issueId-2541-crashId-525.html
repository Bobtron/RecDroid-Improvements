          <p>hi,</p>
<p>i just installed L4M (lineageos for microg). self-checks everything green. added a google account; i got the standard security alert via email. installed the gmail app, gave it all permissions. when i open it, it doesn't see the account configured on the device. if i use it to add a new account, the add works, but then the gmail app continues to not see any account.</p>
<p>i got my GSF ID and added an exception for it on goog. but nothing changed.</p>
<p>too much is happening lately with play certification and i couldn't really keep up.<br>
is this the dreaded <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="308409744" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/510" href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/510">#510</a> ?</p>
<p>also, i installed yalp store, and it cannot log in with the bundled credentials. i did not want to try me real credentials. yalp store on my other device, which is gapps-enabled and where it used to work fine, now says "no network connection".</p>
<p>any pointers? thanks!</p>
