          <p>Most of the time videos hosted on v.redd.it result into application crash for me.</p>
<p>I'm not sure those crashlogs get ever sent to you, so I'm opening this ticket.</p>
<p>Android 4.4, RedReader 1.9.8.3 (latest version available from F-Droid)</p>
<p>Most of the time the crash occurs when I try to open a post while being offline or after being offline.</p>
<p>When it doesn't crash - it handles the video weirdly: it says</p>
<pre><code>Download File
This is a download link. Do you want to load this in an external browser?
</code></pre>
<p>and choosing 'OK' results into opening that video in an external browser.</p>
<p><a href="https://v.redd.it/t2ifcamjibd01/DASH_1_2_M" rel="nofollow">Example video</a> is video/mp4.</p>
