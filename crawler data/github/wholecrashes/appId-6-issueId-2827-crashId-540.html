          <p><strong>Shuttle version:</strong></p>
<p>v1.6.7, Shuttle+ (paid version from Play Store)</p>
<p><strong>Device, OS:</strong></p>
<p>Oneplus 3T, Android 7.1.2 (Lineage OS)</p>
<p><strong>Description of bug:</strong></p>
<p>Creating a new playlist from Folders view hangs the application. Application shows a "Gathering songs..." waiting popup forever while hung.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go into the Folders view, select a folder with mp3 files inside and touch the three dots next to it</li>
<li>Select "Add to playlist &gt; New" from the menu and provide a name for the playlist</li>
<li>Press Save</li>
<li>"Gathering songs..." pop up shows and stays forever, app stops reacting to touch.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expected outcome:</strong></p>
<p>Create a new playlist with songs with selected folder without crashing the app</p>
<p><strong>Observations/Actual Result:</strong></p>
<p>After killing the app via task manager and starting it up again, one can see that an empty playlist with the given name was created before the crash. Trying to add the same folder again to the existing empty playlist works. However, having a crash as a part of regular playlist-creating-via-folder-select workflow isn't the best UX.</p>
<p>Worth noting is also the fact that LineageOS has an app named Privacy Guard for managing app permissions. However, before submitting this bug report, I tested this scenario again with making sure all requested permissions are granted - the bug still happens.</p>
