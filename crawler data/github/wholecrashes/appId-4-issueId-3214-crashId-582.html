          <p>With GitHub having removed support for TLS v1.0 and v1.1, ForkHub no longer works, it gives an error toast (Loading account &amp; organizations failed).</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28943660/how-to-enable-tls-1-2-support-in-an-android-application-running-on-android-4-1" rel="nofollow">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28943660/how-to-enable-tls-1-2-support-in-an-android-application-running-on-android-4-1</a> shows how to enable TLS v1.2 support for pre-Lollipop. There must be something working, since I can access GitHub on both Chrome Mobile and Lightning Browser.</p>
<p>In the meantime,  if anyone can direct me to how to get the "News" look for an arbitrary repo via web browser, I'd appreciate it. The closest I can find is Insights, but that doesn't list individual comments.</p>
