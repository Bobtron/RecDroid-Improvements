          <p>I have a strange issue on a tablet ACER B1-780 (Android 6.0, ARM64). Recognition is fine on 3 first models (GoogleNet, SqueezeNet), but fails on CaffeNet and AlexNet. In fact it returns the following error:</p>
<p>__bionic_open_tzdata_path: ANDROID_DATA not set!<br>
__bionic_open_tzdata_path: ANDROID_ROOT not set!</p>
