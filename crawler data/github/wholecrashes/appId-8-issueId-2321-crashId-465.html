          <p>When one tries to enable location sharing via <em>Google+</em>, the app crashes while trying to open an intent to <code>com.google.android.gms.location.settings.LOCATION_SHARING</code>. There are some legitimate reasons to support this feature within the user's restrictions and even if we should not support location sharing, <code>GmsCore</code> should contain some fallback code, which at least prevents crashing in case one tries to access the location sharing settings.</p>
