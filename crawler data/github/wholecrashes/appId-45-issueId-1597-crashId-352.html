          <p>I save my games in the format   . If I play the same persons twice in one night, I usually just add "#2" after the date. I sometimes email the record to the other player, but last week, I had one record that contained "#2" in the file name, and I ended up having to share it externally.</p>
<p>I just reproduced it on my phone (Nexus 6P Android 7.1.1), and it said, "Unable to attach empty file." Attempting to send the actual game record from my tablet running Android 4.4.4 tries to attach a file with the file name of everything up to the # character, e.g., "game <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="158100" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/ligi/gobandroid/issues/2" href="https://github.com/ligi/gobandroid/issues/2">#2</a>.sgf" becomes "game ", so sending it fails because the file doesn't exist. Uploading to Google Drive also fails with only the message that it was unsuccessful.</p>
