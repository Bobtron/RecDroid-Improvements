          <p>I still cannot get UnifiedNlp working on my LG P880 (stock Android 4.1.2 with GApps pre-installed of course). I've downloaded the <code>UnifiedNlp.apk</code> from here, and installed it on the device with <code>adb install</code> (see also: <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="63148425" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/issues/34" href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/issues/34">#34</a> ). Can open the app, configured two backends so far (the local GSM and openBmap backend). Still, the Xposed module claims it gets a location, but that it doesn't look like a UnifiedNlp one. Checking logcat revealed:</p>
<pre><code>W/LocationManagerService(13440): org.microg.nlp implements com.android.location.service.GeocodeProvider but its signatures don't match those in com.google.android.location, ignoring
</code></pre>
<p>So what's wrong here, and how to fix? Note that uninstalling GApps or using a different ROM is no option for me currently.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've tried working around that making UnifiedNlp a system app, but the very same error remains. So whatever it is, it seems to have protectioLevel "signature" (not "signatureOrSystem"), so this work-around doesn't work around.</p>
