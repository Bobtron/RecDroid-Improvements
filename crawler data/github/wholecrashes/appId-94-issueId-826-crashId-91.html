          <p>Though the F-Droid repo points out this backend should work on Android 2.3.3+, and according to the map my area is covered with a bunch of WiFi APs in the Mozilla database, I couldn't get it to work on my 4.1 device: it returns no location. A closer look with logcat (see <a href="http://pastebin.com/6c0TzmeF" rel="nofollow">this pastebin</a>) suggests something here requires at least Android 4.2. Excerpt:</p>
<pre><code>W/NlpLocationBackendHelper( 8976): java.lang.IllegalStateException: Requires Android 4.2+
[â€¦]
Unbinding from: Intent { act=org.microg.nlp.LOCATION_BACKEND pkg=org.microg.nlp.backend.ichnaea cmp=org.microg.nlp.backend.ichnaea/.BackendService }
</code></pre>
<p>I had tried two other backends before (OpenBmap and Apple) which didn't work either (my area seems not to be covered in their databases), but this error only showed up when I added Ichnaea.</p>
<p>Any clues?</p>
<p>Note: The device is a tablet running Android 4.1.2. There are no newer Android versions available for it (neither stock nor custom ROMs), so I can't do anything from that end. And it has no GSM nor GPS, so my only choices are location services based on WiFi, so I'm currently stuck with these 3 of which none seems to work.</p>
