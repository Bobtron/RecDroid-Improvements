<blockquote>
<p>when I swipe down to refresh (either in the post view or in the comments view) RedReader crashes. That doesn't happen when I use the refresh button though. And it used to work just fine in the previous version. This only seems to happen on my older phone using Android 4.0.</p>

<p>Looks like more testing is needed on older Android versions :)</p>
