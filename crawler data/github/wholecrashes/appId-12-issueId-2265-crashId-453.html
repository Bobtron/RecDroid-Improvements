          <p>Would it be feasible to filter out posts by tag?</p>
<p><a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="335078774" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/issues/603" href="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/pull/603">#603</a> covers urls but if someone wanted to block memes while keeping fan art for example this might not work well and many subs use tags to sort things already.</p>
