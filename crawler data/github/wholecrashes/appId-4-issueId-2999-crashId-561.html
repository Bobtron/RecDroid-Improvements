          <p>You can currently swipe from one issue to the next.</p>
<p>Maybe you can implement this also in the search result view? (When I found <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="50502593" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/issues/1" href="https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/issues/1">#1</a> and <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="50533455" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/issues/3" href="https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/issues/3">#3</a> for example, I want to swipe from <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="50502593" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/issues/1" href="https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/issues/1">#1</a> to <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="50533455" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/issues/3" href="https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub/issues/3">#3</a>)</p>
