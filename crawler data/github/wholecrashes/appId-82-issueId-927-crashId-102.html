          <p>Phil made a temporary fix for <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="138585954" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/issues/600" href="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/issues/600">#600</a> in PR <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="139123525" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/issues/611" href="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/pull/611">#611</a>, but we should really figure out why we're hitting that situation in the first place. It looks like there's a discrepancy between how many items the ListView thinks the adapter has and how many it actually has.</p>
