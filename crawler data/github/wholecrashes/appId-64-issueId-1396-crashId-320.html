          <p>I use two dictionaries for the same language because some words can only be found in one, others in the other. So I often switch between the two, without knowing which one is currently active.</p>
<ul>
<li>The active dictionary is only identified via the flag, which is obviously the same for both dictionaries. (Not counting the info via "About dictionary...")</li>
<li>In the dictionary list the active dictionary is not highlighted.</li>
<li>Selecting the active dictionary from the list is not quicker than switching to any other. If it was I'd know that I haven't switched.</li>
</ul>
<p>I propose to implement any of these (in descending preference):</p>
<ul>
<li>fix <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="140995175" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/rdoeffinger/Dictionary/issues/31" href="https://github.com/rdoeffinger/Dictionary/issues/31">#31</a></li>
<li>highlight/deactivate/grey out the active dictionary in the dictionary list</li>
<li>skip the switching process if the active dictionary is selected</li>
<li>add an info about the current dictionary in the dictionary view</li>
</ul>
