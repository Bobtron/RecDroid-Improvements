          <p>This idea comes from the use cases where I often encounter</p>
<ul>
<li>issues (crashes etc.) on hosts which are not in the infrastructure, or</li>
<li>errors which are displayed only shortly, or</li>
<li>errors which are not logable otherwise</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd love to take a picture of those and simply create/update an issue and append the image. To my mind, this saves a lot of time...</p>
