          <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Any icon or widget placed on the top row could have been unresponsive after a while to the touch.</p>
<h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
<p>Any icon or widget placed everywhere on the screen should have been responsive to the touch the same way regardless of its placement on the screen.</p>
<h2>Actual Behavior</h2>
<p>Any icon or widget placed on the top row could have been unresponsive after a while to the touch in such a way that icon or widget react only to the touch targeted to the low third part of the object.</p>
<h2>Steps to Reproduce</h2>
<ol>
<li>Place Chrome icon on the top row of your screen, for the testing purpose put it to the new blank screen. I choose Chrome icon as a helper just because it is visually divided into thirds, but you can use any icon of course.</li>
<li>After that restart Lawnchair launcher from the Debug menu. (This step is important to quickly trigger the bug with the next two steps, I hope that it will be the hint for the developer why. Without this step, the error appearing will take much more time and it will seems random.)</li>
<li>Long touch the top third (or middle third) of the Chrome icon to display Oreo shortcuts.</li>
<li>Long touch the top third (or middle third) of the Chrome icon once more. Oreo shortcuts will not appear now nor on any consecutive long touch the top third (or middle third) of the Chrome icon.</li>
<li>You could continue from the step number 2 infinitely.</li>
</ol>
<p>or as a workaround</p>
<p>Long touch the bottom third of the Chrome icon to display Oreo shortcuts every time.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Tested on Nexus 5X 8.1.0 and Xiaomi Mi A1 7.1.2 with Lawnchair version 1.1.0.1667.<br>
I even have a colleague at work who confirm this behaviour, but he cannot post here.</p>
