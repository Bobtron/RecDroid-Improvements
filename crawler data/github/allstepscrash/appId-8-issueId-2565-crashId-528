          <p>Please help me because I'm about to explode, as it's been 4 hours I'm trying to solve this.</p>
<p>Basically I clean installed lineageOS microg, and everything works, but I want to sync my calendar and my contacts.</p>
<p>I want an elegant and automatic solution, so downloading GoogleCalendarSyncAdapter solved the issue for the calendar sync without the Google Calendar app, but I'm currently stuck with no Contacts syncing, even though I've installed GoogleContactsSyncAdapter (version 9 that crashed, version 8.1 and other versions).</p>
<p>In settings, accounts, google, (mail account), there is NO contacts switch, only Gmail and Calendar appeared after rebooting.</p>
<p>Plus, when opened, gmail asks me to add an email account because it reads none (even though I logged in my two google accounts at the start of the lineageOS setup) and so I'm stuck there, and cannot read mails (if I receive a mail, I get the notification).</p>
<p>So, what do I have to do to have working Contacts sync and a working gmail?</p>
<p>EDIT: after logging out of an account and opening gmail again the other account showed up on the gmail starting page. From there I added the account I removed and then tapped on "take me to gmail", and now it works perfectly. However, I still need to find a solution to sync my Contacts</p>
