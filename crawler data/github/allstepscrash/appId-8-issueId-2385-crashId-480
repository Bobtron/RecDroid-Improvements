          <p>I have added a google account which works fine with Google Maps and Inbox, but trying to sign in to chromium takes me to the microG "add your account" screen instead of actually signing in. Entering my email gives me a "This account already exists on your device" error.</p>
<p>I'm using microG 0.2.4-50 from the f-droid repo and chromium 58.0.2996.0 from the google dev channel snapshot <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Android/" rel="nofollow">repository</a> on lineageOS 14.1.</p>
