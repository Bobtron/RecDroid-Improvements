<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Memetastic crashes when a picture file of 3000width or 3000 height and above is share to it. However it has no problem opening such files on its own.</p>
<h4>Log</h4>
<p>App version: v1.4.2<br>
Source: F-Droid.org</p>
<p>System:      Android 6.0, Itel p12 (spread chipset)</p>
<p>My expectation was that the app would be able to receive images of such resolution just as flawless as it is able to open them on its own.</p>
<h2>To reproduce??</h2>
<p>Get an image file of 3000 (width or height or both)</p>
<p>Locate the image in your device gallery and send that image to Memetastic.</p>
