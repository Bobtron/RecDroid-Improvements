          <p>(Splitting from another thread (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="66201686" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/issues/374" href="https://github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-android/issues/374">#374</a>) where this was originally mentioned so it can be tracked separately.)</p>
<p>It is helpful to see that data from myTBA. It also allows me to see that there are apparently 2 sets of settings for my team.</p>
<p>From the event page I select my team and then pull up the settings to see only 1 checked:</p>

<p>when I go to myTBA and select the team@event I see all the settings checked:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2994465/6987040/35fad398-d9f8-11e4-976f-5a0bd7a4ab2a.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2994465/6987040/35fad398-d9f8-11e4-976f-5a0bd7a4ab2a.png" alt="notification05mytba" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>This is a disjoin for sure and Im not sure where it came from. Perhaps my reinstall?</p>
<p>Also, can someone explain the how the team and team@event settings are used when they are different? Can I change the settings per team per event?? (Nice but a little confusing!)</p>
