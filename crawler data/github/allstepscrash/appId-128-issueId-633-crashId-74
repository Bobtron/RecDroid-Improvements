          <p>I'd like to start working on the undo feature (issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="138831904" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/valerio-bozzolan/AcrylicPaint/issues/37" href="https://github.com/valerio-bozzolan/AcrylicPaint/issues/37">#37</a>). Since the possibility of crashing is mentioned in that issue's discussion, I'd feel more comfortable if we had some sort of testing procedure; something more formal than just running it on my phone and hoping it doesn't crash. I think setting up a bunch of unit tests might be the solution - since unit tests are usually run in an automated way, I think I could probably set up a bunch of emulators representing different types of devices, then run the unit tests on each emulator automatically.</p>
<p>I don't know if running tests like that is actually possible with the Android SDK &amp; emulators, nor do I know how to create unit tests for an Android app.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
