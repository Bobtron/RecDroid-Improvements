          <h1>Tooling is Good.</h1>
<p>It lets us write good, clean code without having to worry about the the little things. This is a place to compile a list of wants for our app's tooling.</p>
<h2>Lint</h2>
<p>We should be able to run custom linters to catch code patterns that we want to disallow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Android <code>lint</code></li>
<li><a href="http://fbinfer.com" rel="nofollow">infer</a> static analysis</li>
<li>Disallow using <code>android.util.Log</code> and encourage a custom wrapper instead</li>
<li>Always should run on pulls (and preferably make inline comments at errors)</li>
<li>Should be able to run pre-commit or pre-pull</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always should run on pulls</li>
<li>Should be clear what is broken (would be nice to have a bot comment on PR with links to broken lines at fails)</li>
<li>Should be able to run pre-commit or pre-pull</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code Review/Pull Requests</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatically build apks for pull requests and link them?</li>
<li>Actually enforce some sort of code review?</li>
</ul>
