          <p>When I search for the SMSSecure project I don't see it in the search results because it's a fork (see the discussion here: <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="103112226" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/SilenceIM/Silence/issues/232" href="https://github.com/SilenceIM/Silence/issues/232">SilenceIM/Silence#232</a>). Would it be possible to add an setting to search with  fork:true in the project search? Or do I have to type it in by hand? Does this issue arise often in practice?</p>
