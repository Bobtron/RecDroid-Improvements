<p>I try to sync Mirakel against a taskd 1.1 setup. I'm not using self-signed certificates, but Class 3 certificates issued by the community certification authority CAcert. They use an immediate certificate in-between:</p>
<p>Root (CAcert Class 1) -&gt; Intermediate (CAcert Class 3) -&gt; taskd certificate, user certificates</p>
<p>When trying to import the configuration file created following the user guide, I receive following error message: "Die Konfigurationsdatei ist fehlerhaft" (translated back to English something like "The configuration file is broken"), it seems that Mirakel doesn't accept certificate chains.</p>
