          <p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on "Don't keep activities" in Developer Options</li>
<li>Shut down server</li>
<li>Pause / resume post list several times</li>
<li>Notice the list is blank for several seconds (until the request times out, I assume)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution: display a progress bar of some sort while the response / timeout is awaited.
