          <p>When on mobile data (LTE), SlimSocial will load the top of my news feed when I first open it, but as soon as it loads another chunk of the timeline, or I tap a link to go elsewhere in Facebook, I get the "No internet connection" error, and tapping "Try Again" results in the same error message.  (I have no connectivity issues when on WiFi.)</p>
<p>I am running LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1.2).  The version of Android System WebView is 65.0.3325.114.</p>
<p>(This issue sounds similar to <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="180458281" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/rignaneseleo/SlimSocial-for-Facebook/issues/34" href="https://github.com/rignaneseleo/SlimSocial-for-Facebook/issues/34">#34</a>, which was closed over a year ago.)</p>
