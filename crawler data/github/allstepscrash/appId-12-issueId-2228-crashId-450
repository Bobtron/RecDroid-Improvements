          <p>I have RedReader running just fine on my phone, however on my tablet I cannot log into reddit. Every single time I try, over the past two days, I get a <code>net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED</code> error <em>after</em> I login, at the point where reddit asks me to connect and I hit accept. I am not behind any proxies, VPNs, tor, etc and my DNS server is set to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 in my router's DHCP settings; I have tried using a DNS proxy (<a href="http://mayakron.altervista.org" rel="nofollow">Acrylic</a>) on my PC and it shows no DNS errors in the log, therefore I am assuming this is an issue with the app. Actually reading posts anonymously works fine, however that doesn't allow me to post, vote, or read mail; other apps (the official reddit app) have no issues at all.</p>
<p>There is a recording showing the error &amp; system/device info <a href="https://bots.efreakbnc.net/efreak/redreaderfail.mp4" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Logcat is <a href="https://gist.github.com/Efreak/9858472f05612762afa0f6b14e17d5c4">here</a> (there's multiple instances of this that only differ in the timestamp). Obtained via <code>adb logcat -d|grep 14756</code>.</p>
