          <p>I don't see the logic or necessity for what I call, in lack of a better term, "blue link" entries. With that I mean that some entries' translations are not shown in the list. Instead the are blue and underlined and after tapping it's detailed content is shown. It's nice to have the details but the disadvantage is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the translation is not visible at once</li>
<li>the actual translation (usually the info I am looking for) is hidden in the lower part and only visible after some scrolling</li>
<li>the entry cannot be exported via "share" from the list (exports only the search term). Exporting via select and share in the detail view only exports as one field to AnkiDroid (see <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="141028574" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/rdoeffinger/Dictionary/issues/37" href="https://github.com/rdoeffinger/Dictionary/issues/37">#37</a> )</li>
<li>the detailed info is not indexed, hence the translation cannot be looked up (e.g. Spanish "muerte" = German "Sterben". "Sterben" is not found (, only the verb "sterben"=morir).</li>
</ul>
<p>I am aware that the generation of the dictionary obviously is an automated process and the source data seems to be quite messy given the inconsistent structure of the created dictionary. Still, there must be some attribute of an entry that triggers the creation of such a "blue link entry" and I propose to ignore/suppress that.</p>
