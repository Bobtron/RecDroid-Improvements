          <p><strong>Shuttle version:</strong></p>
<p>Any 2.0.0 beta</p>
<p><strong>Device, OS:</strong></p>
<p>Nexus 5x, Oreo 8.1</p>
<p><strong>Description of bug:</strong></p>
<p>If I tap on an artist, and then on any of his/her album, and then tap the back button, the closing animation is missing. If I repeat the operation, the album animation is present. This issue is rather similiar to the issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="255085609" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle/issues/180" href="https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle/issues/180">#180</a> i reported some time ago. It looks like that fix was not implemented in this scenario.</p>
<p>Link to the issue: <a href="url">https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle/issues/180</a></p>
<p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1 Go to the "Artists" tab</li>
<li>Step 2 Select any artist</li>
<li>Step 3 Select any album</li>
<li>Step 4 Go back (by pressing the back button, for instance)</li>
<li>Step 5 Observe that the album closing animation is missing. Album cover is simply reloaded</li>
<li>Step 6 Re-open the same album, and close it again</li>
<li>Step 7 Animation is present</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expected outcome:</strong></p>
<p>The closing animation should be present from the very first time.</p>
<p><strong>Observations/Actual Result:</strong></p>
<p>If Shuttle is closed, animation for that album will be missing again the first time, but it will be present al the next times, until Shuttle remains open.</p>
