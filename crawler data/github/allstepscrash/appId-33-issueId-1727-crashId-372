          <p>When attempting to send ether from a generated wallet to a watch wallet, I got this error message:</p>
<p>rlp: input string too short for common</p>
<p>To ensure all my transaction parameters were correct, I exported my private key and performed the exact same transaction from MyEtherWallet and it worked fine.</p>
