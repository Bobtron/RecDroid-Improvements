          <p>I found this crash on version 1.9.8.1 installed from the F-droid project.<br>

<p>Reproduction steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch redreader. The main screen shown should be the one giving an overview of your subscribed subreddits.</li>
<li>Tap the refresh button in the app bar.</li>
<li>Swipe down while the subscribed subreddits list is refreshing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it might help to reproduce if you're doing this on a slow network. I found it since my network speed is throttled.</p>
