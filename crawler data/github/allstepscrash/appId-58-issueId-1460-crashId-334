          <p>When ApkTrack's search field is opened (by hitting the magnifying glass icon) all other functions in the menu bar at the top are still accessible.  When one enters the settings while the search field is open, it takes either three (!) times clicking on the Android back button (due to issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="272739368" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/JusticeRage/ApkTrack/issues/125" href="https://github.com/JusticeRage/ApkTrack/issues/125">#125</a> ) or closing the search field with its own back button, followed by using the Android back button once, in order to leave the settings.<br>
But then the search and the refresh icon in ApkTrack's main window are gone!  The same applies to the corresponding menu entries (usually accessible via the rightmost button in ApkTrack's title bar).</p>
<p>Suggested solution:<br>
If the search field is changed to fill the whole screen width and hence the other icons are not accessible while it is opened, this issue would not exist.</p>
