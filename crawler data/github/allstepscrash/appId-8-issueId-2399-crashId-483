          <p>Hi.<br>
So the fix for issue <a href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/318">318</a> seams to be working. The app no longer crashes, but the animation is not working very well. It seams to be working to begin with, but slows down more and more like something is building up and getting heavier for each frame.</p>
<p>It's difficult to explain, so I included a screen cast. It's not a big issue. As soon as the animation start, I can press the button that takes me to a new page and then go back, thereby skipping the animation. So I can now use the app. However, there might be other apps that will not work properly, so I thought that I would report it.</p>
