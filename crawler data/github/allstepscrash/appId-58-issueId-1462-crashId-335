          <h3>Background</h3>
<p>Aptoide is the server and client software F-Droid was forked from more than 6 years ago.<br>
Unfortunately Aptoide's developers have decided (stepwise between 2012 and 2016) to pursue a more closed strategy, so the source of the Aptoide server software was made unavailable to the public in 2012 (when it was renamed from BazaarAndroid to Aptoide) and (much worse) its client app has become a data gathering tool digesting ones contacts and account information since version 8.1 (at the end of 2016).</p>
<p>OTOH the Aptoide app store is supposedly the biggest "alternative" app store worldwide with its protocol still being open and client software still being developed as Free Software.</p>

<h3>Feature suggestion</h3>
<p>With the documentation and implementation examples above, integrating the ability to query <em>and</em> download apps directly from Aptoide into ApkTrack should be well feasible.<br>
Side note: On first sight, the Aptoide protocol is also still close to the original F-Droid protocol (i.e. not the newer, revamped F-Droid "v1" protocol).</p>
<p>In a second step Aptoide could be also offered as a Search Engine in ApkTrack.</p>
<p>Furthermore Aptoide provides most non-paid apps available on Google Play Store, which requires an account to download apps (no matter if paid or non-paid ones).<br>
Similarly with the feature requests (e.g. issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="70411335" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/JusticeRage/ApkTrack/issues/51" href="https://github.com/JusticeRage/ApkTrack/issues/51">#51</a> ) for the Amazon App Store, which would require tedious reverse engineering of the details of its protocol first.<br>
Also both, Amazon and Google, may regard the ability to directly download apps from their app stores in ApkTrack as an unfriendly action and might counteract legally.</p>
