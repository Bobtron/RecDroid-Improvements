<p><strong>Description of bug:</strong></p>
<p>I have a "various artists" problem: when 'album artist' tag is specified as "Various artists" the whole album displays same artwork from song <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="210253048" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle/issues/1" href="https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle/issues/1">#1</a> (or whatever I play first), ignoring the covers embedded in id3 tags.<br>
Pulsar, Musicolet, Retro Music, doubletwist Music Player, Poweramp, Neutron don't have that issue. It's same exact albums.</p>
