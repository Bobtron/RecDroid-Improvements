          <p>Hello. This is follow on from <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="36100457" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/issues/147" href="https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader/issues/147">#147</a></p>
<p>The guardianproject created a number of libraries for developers to use in their software to improve their security.</p>
<p>I would like to make the suggestion that you implement their IOCipher and SQLCipher[1] libraries into RedReader</p>
<p>The biggest benefits would be</p>
<p>IOCipher:</p>
<ul>
<li>On install users could create a password specific to RedReader, this would then protect all RedReader files inside an encrypted container.</li>
</ul>
<p>If on install a user chose not to set a password RedReader would be stored on the device as normal</p>
<p>SQLCipher</p>
<ul>
<li>provide an encrypted sqlite database to ensure information is kept secure.</li>
</ul>
