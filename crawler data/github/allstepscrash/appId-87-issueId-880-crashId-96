          <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing a great app! Especially on f-droid repo.</p>
<p>I have tried to use it with theoldreader.com account.<br>
And have some issue.<br>
Login, initial sync seems like OK, but sync after (marked) read smth is fail.<br>
I have got errors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sync failed: Invalid HTTP status 404 ... /api/0/stream/contents/user/-/label/labelname?n=...</li>
<li>Sync failed: Invalid JSON</li>
<li>Sync failed: Invalid long: "123abc..."</li>
</ul>
<p>I think a source of issues can be in a some <a href="https://github.com/theoldreader/api#differences">difference</a> to Google Reader API.<br>
There is an API link: <a href="https://github.com/theoldreader/api">https://github.com/theoldreader/api</a></p>
<p>Is it possible to fix those issues?</p>
