Indeed it seems to affect specifically the Galaxy S (something related the audio architecture or to the network buffering). The effect does not seems to affect other devices I tested.
I notice long delay also with other VOIP software, hence it may be a common architecture problem. Could someone with the I9000 give a feedback about this?</p>

<p>an update,  I installed a SSH server in the galaxy S and logging inside using an SSH client I notice the same latency in the echo of the characters I digit.
(I receive the echo after 1-2 second). (If I time using a local terminal there is not such delay). It could be definitely something in the network.</p>

<p>I look forward for your feedback</p>

There is a well known bug on HTC device that enter in what they call "PSP mode" when screen goes off. In this case data packets are dropped or received with a high delay.
It's due to the fact the wifi card goes in a special mode (that is not sleep mode) which save battery but impact applications that try to get live packets from the network.</p>

<p>It could  be the same kind of problem on this device. What you could test to ensure it's not the case is to keep the screen on and try the same test with SSH (or with the app).
If it helps there is a settings that activate a workaround in csipsimple in settings &gt; Userinterface &gt; keep awake while in call (you've to switch to expert settings mode before : in Settings &gt; press menu and choose "expert mode")</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The settings "Keep awake while on call"
and          "Use partial was lock"
seems to have no effect on the delay</p>

<p>I measured the delay using a loop-back service of my SIP provider (i.e. the loop-back is inside my SIP sub-net hence I can hear my echo in the fastest way possible). The total delay of a round trip is around 1-1.1sec using ILBC and in PCMU.
(it is interesting that the delay seems to not change with the streaming bandwidth)</p>

<p>There is no appreciable difference with the screen on or off (I also checked the effect of the lock of the screen due to the proximity sensor and it is none)</p>

<p>I also notice something interesting by testing with SSH. The echo of the first character I digit is always the longest, than if I quickly repeatedly digit the echo seems almost instantaneous. If I stop and start to digit again the echo if slow again. If seems somekind of sleep mode (however the VOIP packet streaming should be dense enough to avoid this ).</p>

<p>However still looking for the light. Can someone with a Galaxy S i9000 report his experience about this?</p>

Just FYI, I've tested on the galaxy S (i9000) of a colleague and didn't observe a high latency. 
Maybe the problem with SSH is another thing (maybe the implementation of the server you installed do things to save battery).</p>

<p>Did you try with another sip application on android with the same configuration (same SIP provider, same remote party and same bandwidth) (for example with linphone, or sipdroid?). Are the results better with one of these other android SIP app?</p></markdown-widget>

However, SIP DROID indicates that it measure a latency between 80mS and 140mS (I'm not sure what this number refer to). What I did it simply to measure the delay between the echo in a loop-back call.</p>

<p>I do notice that pinging my server from my phone seems to vary between 2ms-20ms while my laptop over the same wireless connection is consistently ~1ms.  So there does seem to be some quirkiness in the network stack on my N1.  However even with that 20ms*2 == 40 &lt; 1000ms.</p>

<p>I'll wait for Gingerbread to drop and test with the built-in SIP stack.  If that fails I'll try rooting my phone to upgrade the radio's firmware and let you know of any changes.</p></markdown-widget>

In 2.3 google has added OpenSL support so I'll add it to CSipSimple which may improve perfs.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As I said, with Froyo  things improved and I can talk. I guess that there could be a dependence on the actual ROM installed. In any case there is a large difference between the reported latency (like 40-70mS) and the real one. I checked with sipdroid (which actually shows a lower real latency) but still the reported latency is smaller than the real one. (Even if I compared with half of a round trip)</p>

<p>I removed the echo suppression but nothing really changed. Is it possible to modify
the ptime value to reduce the delay (maybe?)?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>An attempt at better quantifying the latency puts it at ~400ms.  I don't know if this is an improvement over the past before factory reset et al, or whether I was overestimating the 1sec.  Something that I do notice is that pinging my phone over wifi cycles from about 25ms to 250ms.  This type of ping latency would 100% explain the audio delay.  When pinging FROM my phone I get 5-15ms.</p>

<p>@m.peccianti Do you experience similar high latency when pining your phone?
@r3gis.3R Do you have consistently <em>better</em> latency when pining your phones?</p>

<p>If this is indeed the case, this then bug is out of CSipSimple's scope and hopefully Google fixes it in Gingerbread.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I think you got something else. actually When I ping my SGS I get something around 150-250mS. However if you go in call with CSIPSIMPLE (also with SIPDROID) the ping fall down to 2-3mS. In my opinion that is something related to the power management (when your mobile does nothing) </p>

Pings to my phone drop to 1-2ms with spikes to 35ms while a SIP call is active.

<p>I'm surprised tx jitter is so high, but I don't think that's high enough to be the culprit.  My understanding was that jitter is out-of-order packets.  But how does that happen for TX?  Shouldn't the phone be transmitting everything in order?  I'm probably misunderstanding a part and it's probably inconsequential to the symptoms I'm experiencing.</p>

I don't know why I didn't test this before.  An echo test doesn't tell us whether the delay is evenly distributed between encoding/sending or receiving/decoding.  I just tested with a phone instead of the echo server.... and sending is working perfect (near-instant).  Receiving, however, is responsible for all of the delay.</p>

<p>Does the underlying library provide any reports on the timings of data from when it's received to when it's sent to the speaker?  This would permit us to see if the delay is within the SIP stack or not.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>However something that is known is that there is some progress possible on the step stack =&gt; hardware speaker. For now as android doesn't provide sufficient native binding to the audio layer it was required to pass buffer to java layer (actually the shortest path is to path directly to JNI layer).
This introduce a little latency and may be improved in the future cause from android 2.3, we will have access to OpenSL which will allow applications to talk directly to hardware without bothering with java. So it may improve things on some device (there is also a new private API for acquiring a lock on "high perfs wifi").</p>

<p>For the pure driver latency I estimate that using native instead of java will benefit about 20ms of improvement for in and out.</p>

<p>There is some tests tools however in pjsip (see <a href="http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/audio-check-sound-device-jitter">http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/audio-check-sound-device-jitter</a>)
I have a way to activate this test utility (I played long time ago with that ;) ). If you are interested I can include that in next build but will require you to have the android sdk installed to see logcat.</p></markdown-widget>

You press menu button in settings and there is an "Audio test" option. 
It will output some infos about the current audio driver in the logcat tool.
 * Activated debug mode on your phone (it's in android settings in application in development)
 * plug phone to your pc in usb
 * launch ddms on the PC 
 * In csipsimple turn on logging (in settings &gt; user interface &gt; log level -&gt; 4)</p>

<p>And finally launch the "Audio test" option. Nothing will appear on the android phone screen but on ddms/logcat you'll have rapport of the pjsip stack about the audio driver. I'll try to add another basic test of local echoing so that we can actually test the latency just introduced by the audio driver. It will be probably also very interesting.</p></markdown-widget>

There was too much lag even after upgrade to DDJP6 (Froyo - 2.2 verison for India). Last week i flashed my SGS with the XXJPY firmware and tried using sipdroid. It was better that before but still very jittery. I tried Csipsimple and everything worked fine if I used a lower quality coded (GSM, still bit laggy with PCMA/PCMU). I use Terrasip.net and I have to connect using a VPN as VOIP is blocked in UAE. After the upgrade to XXJPY the call quality is same as what i had earlier with my N900 &amp; Nokia 5800. </p>

<p>Maybe the upgrade to JPY solved the problem or simply reflashing the device did it?? </p></markdown-widget>
