Fantastic product, simple and smart. The only problem I have is the echo the other party hears. Otherwise the quality is good. Any ideas how to work with that?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Problem is that it's actually a remaining bug from Sony. </p>

<p>I tested on a friend phone and tweaking speaker and micro amplification may help.
Also in nightly builds there is some new options for echo cancellation. I didn't test on a X10. But worth to test to set echo cancellation mode to Speex echo canceller and echo tail length to 100ms.</p>

<p>Else we have to wait for Sony to fix that... 
They have already fixed their driver in 2.1 cause in 1.6 it was absolutely awful. Sony has really few experience with android so they have this kind of problem with their ROM. They promised to be better in 2011 :)... I hope that they will backport their fix for their future device to X10 and X8 series.</p></markdown-widget>

And the how to install : HowToInstallDevVersion wiki page.</p>

<p>If you get some interesting result do not hesitate to share it here or in any open issue about echo cancellation. These kind of settings are really dependent of the device. Increasing echo tail length require more CPU processing but may result better echo cancellation on some device.
So if you find some good settings for X10 I can set your values as defaults ones for X10 users.</p></markdown-widget>

In fact this VOICE_CALL input is a hack specific for a "bug" in the way sony interprete the android audio api.
Normally VOICE_CALL should not work on devices cause most of the time in this mode GSM and micro are directly plugged together without giving audio frame to the application layer.</p>

<p>The default micro input should works when the manufacturer do things as it should be. 
I guess guys that support your ROM did things more cleanly on with the glue between android and the device driver. So this hack is probably not relevant for you. If with your rom you have a very big echo, you should alert guys that support your ROM that they use the sony driver and that this driver is crappy and as consequence they should allow you to use the driver a way the micro does not record the output sound.</p>

<p>It could be interesting to test other micro source entry. 
Some may just make the app crash - simply cause not supported in this android version - so reboot if it crashes to ensure audio driver is not in a bad state.</p>

<p>Hopefully future official upgrade from sony will fix all these crappy things with their driver. I tested an Xperia Arc and they now use the android API the right way (besides with android 2.3, there is an official api specific for call over IP).</p></markdown-widget>
