<ol>
<li>Root Phone, running Cyanogen 6.1.2 (Motorola Droid in my case)</li>
<li>CSipSimple (Version: 0.01-01 r615) Installed on Phone, and setup to register with 'Basic'  Account to a SIP Server (In my case? An Asterisk Box running on CentOS)</li>
<li>Reboot your phone once after installation</li>
</ol>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>When the phone is rebooted, or cold-booted I get the following error when CSipSimple loads: 
"Another Application is currently using SIP Port! Can't Start!!"</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
CSipSimple 0.01-01 r615; Using Cyanogen Mod 6.1.2 (Froyo) on Motorola Droid (OG)</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>CSipSimple was working flawlessly for about a week, and seems to be by far as the best SIP Client on Android.  However, after a week the App ceased functioning properly.  It hung my phone after a SIP Call with a client the other day (Hung the phone on hangup).  After a reboot I religiously receive the following error:</p>

<p>"Another Application is currently using SIP Port! Can't Start!!"</p>

<p>I've tried removing all traces of the app from my phone, and reinstalling it.  The same issue reappears.  I've tried rebooting the phone and removing the battery, again same issue.</p>

<p>I thought it might be an issue with the phone itself and how it interfaces with the SIP Protocol or another app holding onto the port (like the error indicated), so I install SIPDroid and it worked perfectly.  However? I much prefer your app to SIPDroid.</p>

<p>I managed to grab some of a log file that shows the issue on startup and in just a usage case after boot.  They're attached to this post.
Any help / suggestions that could be provided are very welcome.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Check all your applications installed on your phone. There is probably another one that make SIP or other stuff that prevent CSipSimple from binding 5060 port.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you don't find the application or if you'd like both application running at the same time :
* Switch to ExpertSettingMode (see wiki page)
* Go in Network &gt; TCP port change 5060 to something else for example 6060
* And same thing for UDP port.

Just to be sure... You have CSipSimple installed on your phone ? </p>

<p>If nettalk bind SIP port it's probably cause it use SIP too. If so it is probably possible to use any other sip app to use your nettalk account.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>However, if it's really the problem, you could try to list the applications installed on your device. If you see other sip application (or voice over ip application), it's probably the culprit. 
To really know about the other app that register this port you would actually need to use some advanced debugging tool (such as adb shell) and list used ports with netstat tool. But that's not really easy to do if you never played with linux system before ;).
So maybe easier just to see other installed apps.</p>

<p>Another point, normally recent versions of csipsimple use as default UDP port a random port (to avoid this kind of conflict). So if you enter "0" in the Local UDP port setting it will choose something random and should never conflict with another app in terms of local listening port. But maybe your problem is different and about the fact there is another softphone registered on your server and that your server refuse to have 2 devices registered at the same time. Normally in this case, sip server just drop the older registration and so there is no problem.</p>

<p>So, maybe you could try to collect some logs (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page). Maybe I'll find a more precise clue on what is failing.</p></markdown-widget>

thank u for your quick answer i tried your proposal i put the udp zero same result
i enabled the logs and i tried 3 scenarios
- i put first udp and tcp pprt 5060 then tried to register which was always inactive
- i changed the udp and tcp to 6060 tried to register always registering
- i changed the udp to zero again registering 
i sent the logs i am nt sure if it will reach you or other support </p>
