The G729 codec is patented one.
It was not clear for all users how the licensing works and put me (distributor of the app) in a not very clear situation where I distribute an app with g729 inside but tell users it's their responsibility if their activate or not the option and take a end user license for their own version of the app.
As I don't want to get problems with how the app is distributed and that I found some kind company that was ready to produce and distribute a g729 plugin for csipsimple with the resell of the g729 codec patent inside, it was decided to drop from the mainstream the g729 codec support.</p>

<p>You can now at choice ;
 * download the g729 plugin from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple.plugins.codecs.g729">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple.plugins.codecs.g729</a>
(note that the company is not me and I don't make any benefit on it, and from the price they resell the license I think they don't do any benefit either ;) ).
 * do your own build of the g729 codec plugin based on the source code and use it the way it's authorized for g729 when you build things by your own : just for tests/implementation purposes.</p>

<p>For more details about the price of the codec :

I looked at my "slow" codec choices, and noticed G.729 has been omitted. I then went back to my latest back up, just so I could make an outgoing call.</p>

<p>I've already paid $10 for a G.729 license on my Asterisk server. I realize that G.729 is essentially the only codec that can be used over 3g, and absolutely none of this is your fault, but come on, how many times do I have to pay for this stupid thing? I was under the assumption that if you're transcoding, or using the codec commercially, you need to pay royalty fees per channel. I'm transcoding from uLaw to G.729 on my server, and then the media is passed to CSS. Am I missing something? I don't see the need to pay for another license.</p>

<p>Apparently Zoiper is reselling the G.729 codec for CSipSimple? It looks like I'll be stuck on r2165, or I'll have to start compiling CSS from source. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience with SILK over 3g? </p></markdown-widget>

It handcuff users and people trying to provide software to users. The use of codec is something viral. When a sip provider push for a codec it pushes sip clients provider do deliver the codec ... and when it's a paid one, it force everybody to pay for something they didn't choose.
That's because their model requires each endpoint have a license (so not only server side, even softphones). H
owever, if you are a sip provider and already paid for a global g729 license (not linked to a specific software, you can do your own build of the csipsimple g729 codec plugin and install it on your phone). But it will only be valid only for you and your own usage.</p>

<p>About Silk is excellent codec ! 
It's the codec that comes from skype and is still used in skype. So it's very good and works well for low bandwidth. You should definitely try. It also use lower CPU than g729 (that is not optimized for ARM while silk is). It has great quality and low bandwidth usage; and it's an opensourced one that allows anyone to easily integrate and use it.</p></markdown-widget>

Actually at the time I started to integrate and redistribute silk what was requested was an explicit email with information (was before skype was acquired by microsoft and before most of other sip client integrated it in December 2010). I guess the form is just automation of the email request.</p>

<p>I didn't reproduced for the integration of Opus (that, as you know, integrates some silk source code) but the source code in opus is redistributed under BSD terms and Microsoft/Skype accepted that. (see : <a href="http://www.opus-codec.org/license/">http://www.opus-codec.org/license/</a>). And as far as I understood from this license it also covers usage of silk patents; so it's double safe to use SILK.</p></markdown-widget>
