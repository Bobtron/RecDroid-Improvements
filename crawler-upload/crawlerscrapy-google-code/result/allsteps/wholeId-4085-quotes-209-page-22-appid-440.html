1.codecs no work

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
my problem and that I can not use the speex codec iLBC and silk. iLBC codec works but very bad quality the others do not work. I know that my equipment has ARMv6 cpu and do not know how to enable iLBC codec I tried the page of mozila firefox and I can not understand how to solve the problem. regis know that s expert in this matter and would appreciate that correcting these errors.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>LG optimus one and csipsimple nighties rev658</p>

<p>As for others codecs I'll have a look.
What do you mean by 'don't work'? Can you get logs? What is the precise behavior? Call is not established, the codec is not choosen by the negociation?</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>As for your details I don't think it is a bug.</p>

<p>To use a codec, you must support it on your side BUT the OTHER side has to support the codec too.</p>

<p>What you describe is typical of the fact the other side does NOT support any of enabled codecs.</p>

<p>So the problem is not on CSipSimple side but on other side !!! The other side must support codec to decode / encode in this codec.... That's logic. 
I guess that you are trying to use a PSTN gateway somewhere that does not support the codec. If you try SIP to SIP with a server that does not do media gateway, it's almost sure that it will work properly if both SIP ends support selected codecs.</p>

<p>Usually most 'free' pstn gateway does only support PCMU/A (some support g729). But be really careful with G729. You have to had the right to place calls with it. It's a proprietary codec. And I do not provide the license to use it ! It's here just for those who already have a valid use license for it.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>On your device screen should not goes off on wifi. The keep awake while in call option as described in the FAQ should be on. Else you'll experiment bad quality on wifi.</p>

<p>On 3G, problem you experiment is different. 
First of all, check what is supported by the remote party. If you try to call with a codec not supported by the other party the SIP negociation will fallback to the first available codec supported by both party. If you disable all codecs excepted some codecs, you'll experiment direct hang up. That's normal, the negociation fail cause you announce the other part you support only codecs that it does not support.</p>

<p>So first of all get the list of what is supported by the other side. You can test, if you activate only speex 8kHz in csipsimple for example and left all other disabled and that the call directly hangup (red screen), it mean that the other part does NOT support this codec.</p>

<p>Once you have the entire list of supported codec by other side, you'll see what you can do with this remote side.</p>

<p>If, as I guess regarding all your comments, the remote party ONLY support PCMU/A, you can activate all codecs of the world in CSipSimple, if the other side does only support PCMU/A you will ONLY be able to communicate with him with PCMU/PCMA.</p>

<p>Any SIP client can do nothing with that. That's cause of the SIP server ! not cause of the client. If you'd like to use more codecs, use a SIP server that use more codecs. Some apps such as Fring and Skype use their own server as gateway between you and the rest of the world as consequence they can use codecs they want. To get the same thing in SIP, you have to use a SIP server that provide same level of feature. Again the SIP client can do nothing with that !!</p>

<p>As consquence, if you want to use SIP over 3G, you'll usually need a SIP <em>SERVER</em> that support more codecs than just PCMU/A which use a lot of bandwidth. I can't do nothing on my side if your SIP server does not support other codecs !</p></markdown-widget>
