1. install cSipSimple
2. configure sip account
3. make a call</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>Expected to have normal audio via earpiece and that other side can hear me.
Instead the audio is being played from the speaker (not earpiece) in double speed and the other side only hears static (i.e. the mic is not working).</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Latest version from the Market running on Android 2.2</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>I have tried to play with the various options via the media preferences. nothing helps.
cSip has worked just fine on any other phone i have tried to date. it does not work well on the Atrix for some reason.</p></markdown-widget>

Here are the results:</p>

<p>Changing media &gt; clockrate to 32KHz restuls in audio playing choppy still from the speaker and at 1/2 speed instead x2 speed with the default setup.</p>

<p>Checking "use mode audio API" is resulting in no sound at all.
Checking "use routing API" makes no difference
Checking "tone hack" makes no difference.</p>

<p>I know that Tango had the same problem but they were able to fix this (audio coming out of earpiece and mic working properly). Also Fring is working properly in regards to audio (coming out of speaker, but no choppy, and mic working fine).
Skype however does not work with the mic.</p>

<p>If i grabbed a logcat when calling on Tango - will this help?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Seems to be a bug on Motorola side :
"""
I got response from platform engg team and they say it is a bug in Atrix initial release. They say it is fixed now and it will be pushed in next maintainance release. I do not know when the next release will be pushed but hopefully soon. I will keep you informed about this.
"""</p>

<p>A workaround is probably possible using another source for micro. (There is two micro sources on Atrix?).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in CSipSimple this is managed in the native stack layer and it would be extremely complicated to change in a "configurable way" (that does not break all other android platform). 
I could try some hardcode hacks but if I'm completely blind I will don't know where to try. So I'll ask on forum if they can help me more precisely.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>I get some feedback from Motorola guys. They are very reactive that's great :)</p>

<p>Regarding their feedback the atrix already has a echo canceller that could conflict with a software echo-canceller.
As consequence they advise to disable it in the app if frequency is set to 8kHz.</p>

<p>So :
In csipsimple media settings &gt; Disable echo cancellation and disable VAD</p>

<p>Try 8kHz and 16kHz.</p>

<p>Also I'd be interested by a pure loopback audio test (with logs). To do so :
 * Turn on log recording : (in csipsimple dialer - press menu &gt; help &gt; Record logs..)
 * Then go in csipsimple settings, press menu and select "Expert mode"
 * Then press again menu button and press "Test audio".
It will open a little popup and you'll have a loopback audio test. (It directly send what is recieved from mic to the earpiece).
 * Press back (it will quit the test mode), press back again (you should be on the main dialer), press menu &gt; help &gt; Stop log recording and send it. It will propose to send logs to me :)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For the screen off issue, that's known problem on many other devices, just follow these instructions, it usually solves the problem :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ#When_screen_goes_off_sound_quality_is_bad">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ#When_screen_goes_off_sound_quality_is_bad</a></p>

<p>Now last step would be to have it correctly running on the earpiece.
Could be interesting to do a new pass on audio hacks now :

<p>Thank you, finally working. I am running the latest firmware from motto, 1.5.7. Although this does not address the problem with there audio api. All sip are still broken.</p>

<p>The settings that work with sip are as follows:</p>

<p>Under settings audio select clock rate then make sure 32khz is selected.</p>

<p>Next still under audio settings select and check use routing api.</p>

<p>Finally for insuring good audio when the screen is off select user interface from main menu and check box for keep awake on call.</p>

<p>I successfully tested the above working with at&amp;t atrix running latest ota 1.5.7 routed handset on pbxes.org.</p>

<p>Once again thank you so much for your prompt response.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I see there is no longer a need to change the sample rate or the audio mode in advanced settings.  I see there's a new 'Micro Source' menu item.  I've tried all seven of the microphone possibilities under 'Micro Source'.  Only three seem to work, the other 4 lock the program up and CSipSimple restarts.  DEFAULT and VOICE_RECOGNITION yields the same very loud white noise, with unintelligible audio mixed in, on the other end of the call.  CAMCORDER (the default setting) yields clear and legible audio, but again, the microphone is at the top of the phone therefore the program is only useful if you're using headphones and you speak into the top of the phone.  </p></markdown-widget>

<p>I guess that's what we can get as the best config for now cause of motorola implementation. </p>

<p>Hopefully they'll fix it in a next OTA update... If they do, do not hesitate to update this thread so that I can change default settings to use the correct micro instead of the camcorder one that their current audio driver force us to use.</p>

<p>Again thx for the tests. As soon as the rest of the app will be stable enough I'll release that on the android market.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate to share this info to other SIP/VoIP projects and if other projects needs more details on the two workarounds used they can ask here. In this kind of situation if each opensource sip project can help others I think that it will benefit all users :).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Can you take another look at this? With the new Atrix firmware (1.8.3), Skype now works flawlessly. I thought maybe the update would let me use the market csipsimple too, but it's still broken. If you can do whatever Skype did, that would be awesome. Atrix csipsimple using the rear microphone is pretty impractical.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>=&gt; Usually this one is cause UDP packets size are too big. You should try to activate the option "Use Compact mode". What provider are you using?</p>

<p>That's strange that the nightly worked previously. Maybe it's broken now with the newer 1.8.3. I think I should consider try to get an Atrix to really test on. This kind of issue is really hard to debug without a device to test on directly.</p></markdown-widget>

Depending on the way you create the account and the size of UDP packets (latest versions produce bigger SDP packets cause supports more codecs), CSipSimple can try to switch to TCP which will lead to this behavior (not able to end the call).
Try the "Use compact mode", it can help in this case. (Or you can try to disable a couple of codecs in codecs list, for example only keep PCMU/A).</p></markdown-widget>

On incoming calls, I hear the other person fine, but for the other person it just sounds like I'm tapping my microphone with my finger. This happens with any of the above micro sources, including camcorder. Also, agreed on the speakerphone thing.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi. Just giving an update since I figured out the problem I was having on the Atrix. After taking a look at the info logs, I noticed that on outgoing calls, which were working fine, it was using PCMU 8khz. On incoming calls, which were not working (as described in my last post), it was using speex 8khz. Another detail I noticed was that on ending the call on my Atrix, the other phone would hear a high pitched tone.</p>

<p>Anyway, I disabled the speex 8khz codec, and now it uses PCMU 8khz for both outgoing and incoming and works fine. Now if my understanding is correct, these codecs are only used to talk to my sip provider, which translates and sends a different stream to the other phone. So my guess is that pbxes.org has poor support for the speex codec? If that's right, seems like an easy fix to csipsimple. In fact, it may already be implemented because I'm using the generic (advanced) sip account and not the premade pbxes.org one.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Well as for the micro source, I just received a Motorola Atrix to test on. Sounds the version I have of the ROM can manage the standard MIC as well. The only requirement seems to be the frequency of the earpiece (32kHz).</p>

<p>So I'll change the code of the app to automatically setup as micro source MIC instead of CAMCORDER -which is indeed on the top of the phone-.</p>

<p>For info the ROM version I have installed on the phone I received is 4.2.10 . I guess that's the current official version.</p></markdown-widget>
