1. set dialer to use TXT mode 
2. change keyboard to '12#' and enter a digit
3. after each digit the keyboard returns back to 'abc' mode </p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Switching between '12#' to 'abc' should be done by user and not automatically after entering every new digit.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Latest nightly build - r1184. Android 2.1</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
With the new keyboard setting it's very difficult to enter series of digits (e.g. &lt;sip:1234567@domain.com:5080&gt;). Keyboard switches back to character mode ('abc') after entering every new digit... I need to manage it manually. When I want to enter text, I use 'abc' mode, when I need to enter numbers, I expect keyboard to be in '12#' mode until I'm done with the number.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Now, on the other side. The current builds (after revision r1158) become huge in size. I've got several times (actually, the first times for my smartphone) that I have to manage applications, because of some space problem. With these new builds CSS starts using (I've just checked) 14.36MiB. It's about 10 times more, then Sipdroid and ONiON (other similar applications on my phone). Is there anything that could be done to mitigate the problem (keep CSS size in control)?</p>

<p>And second. I've not caught the exact sequence of events, leading to that scary system message (no space), but it seems that after several attempts to do it differently (from CSS | Help | "Update nightly build", then with or without CSS running...) I may somehow bypass it and eventually install CSS. Thus, my guess is - there is something wrong with installation procedure, that, in some occasions, may prevent CSS from installation. And then suddenly I can do it successfully. It's just a guess at this point. But it could be some problem (instability) with the latest CSS installer.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>About file size in fact, it's due to the fact that nightly builds are now built in debug mode (which deeply increase size) and about the fact it includes many stuff for video (there is ffmpeg inside that is not necessarily stripped down yet).</p>

<p>So don't worry about final size. The first point is that nightly builds will be soon back to be done in release mode. (I do that for now in order to have a complete feedback when it crashes). The second point is that video feature will be available as a separate plugin. There is already all technical points OK to do that. It's now just about integration issue (create a new package and add it to build process). It will land soon, and according to my first analysis it will almost come back to previous size. </p>

<p>There is also another way to reduce again the size of the app, it's to do a custom build just for your target CPU architecture. Since android support 2 CPU archs officially for now (armeabi and armeabi-v7a), for now I include the 2 versions of the library. So the size of the native part is almost twice bigger than what it should actually be.
Previously I did automatically builds for only armeabi or armeabi-v7a to distribute optimal size package. I may also add soon to my automated build system this again.</p>

<p>So don't worry size is still a big matter for me. And that's known drawback of recent builds to be heavy and things are under control to keep size not so huge.</p>

<p>About your second point can you try to collect me logs for this use case?
Also, the upgrade test is done automatically each day at launch of the application. If no updates are available, no popup will be shown. If you go in help &gt; update nightly, it will force a check. But if no updates are available nothing will happen. 
If you get the popup about the fact that there is a new version available, </p></markdown-widget>

</blockquote>

<p>It's good to see your concern about it and it's good that there is a way to reduce the size of the app. Smartphones have limited resources and every byte is at count, you know... Making video as a separate plug-in is a very good idea. Many folks don't need it so far and use CSS just as a phone. Providing installation package for only specific CPU arch is another good idea, especially if it reduces the overall size two times. Why to keep on small smartphone code for all possible architectures? It's like the latest Windows OS's keep drivers for all hardware, known to the world, on each and every computer... Plain stupid, but possible (they suggest - jut buy a new big hard drive). With tiny resources of contemporary smartphones it's a big problem.</p>

<p>So far, CSS is the biggest program on my smartphone. Sipdroid, for comparison, takes just 1.84MiB.</p>

<p>With regards to the system warning (there is no space available), where / how should I check that space?
For example, at the moment "OS Monitor" indicates:
/system - 36 MiB available
/data - 35 MiB available
/sdcard - 1,242 MiB available
/cache - 24 MiB available
So, it looks like space is available...</p></markdown-widget>
