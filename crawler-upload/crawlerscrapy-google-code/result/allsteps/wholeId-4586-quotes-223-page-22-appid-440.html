1. Call someone.
2. Talk with said someone.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
This is a mixed bag, as I have had one person complain of echo and one person not. I need to test it more thoroughly. Echo Cancellation and Voice Detection were enabled, but the person I called still complained of her voice echoing on her end. I couldn't hear echo on my end.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Stable market version. Have not yet tested it on the development version (but I will be). Phone is Droid Incredible running SkyRaider 2.5.2. I have noticed that this seems to happen with all the SIP clients I've tried, so maybe it's a hardware issue? That would be unfortunate. This was over WiFi when the echo issues occurred.</p></markdown-widget>

As consequence on some device what application record is the mix between the micro hardware and the output line :(... That's the case for example for the Sony Ericson X10.
As direct consequence the person in the other end will both ear your voice (from the mic) and his voice (from the earpiece/mic).</p>

<p>Decreasing speaker amplification (in media settings) can helps a lot (for example 0.2). But that's just a workaround. You can also try to increase media quality (to 5 for example).</p>

<p>However, Echo Cancellation feature should solve this problem, but I guess I'm doing something wrong with it (or don't configure it properly). So this is indeed an open point and I have to find out why the echo cancellation feature (from pjsip sip stack) doesn't work properly.</p>

<p>Anyway, let me know if media quality or speaker amplification feature helps, I'm interested in it.</p></markdown-widget>

The HTC hero on which I test is running official 2.1 and I don't observe echo. So I guess it's something with the android version, If you can precise me the version I'll probably be able to reproduce and maybe solve the issue.
Another question when you say that there is echo, I assume that's the remote party that is experimenting echo, isn't it? Else if you are hearing the echo of your voice on your hero and your remote party has on his side no echo... it means that who produce the echo is the remote party and not you. The party annoyed with echo is quietly never the cause of the problem.</p></markdown-widget>
