1. Charge the freerunner fully
2. Note value in /proc/uptime
3. Leave it idle, not charging for 4 hours. The phone should receive no
phone calls or SMSes during the test.
4. Observe the /proc/uptime increase by 3 hours 22 minutes (!) and
   battery at 68% full. Have it slept for 40 minutes only out of the 4
hours it was suspended for??</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
The /proc/uptime should remain almost the same (minus about 40 seconds for
suspend and several seconds to wake up, connect and read the /proc/uptime)
and battery should hold much more charge.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>At the begninning I didn't had this issue; then I installed some apks and I noticed 
this issue to happen again... However I don't really think this issue related to 
anything from third party. But today I noticed a strange behavior in fact, I 
navigated some time at the university using the wifi and disabling the suspension at 
all; then, before of going home, I turned on the suspension and everything worked 
well (the phone was suspended correctly, I couldn't hear the "resume 'clicks'" nor 
turning on the LCD with many AUX pressures [that works when resuming fails]; I also 
was able to turn wakeup and suspend it again)... Then I come home, some hours later, 
and I resumed the phone: since then It never goes to sleep anymore :|.</p>

<p>To get the point, however, I think that we should look at the rtc implementation, in 
fact these resumes are all caused by the rtc interrupt timer as you can see from:</p>

<h1>cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0073/resume_reason</h1>

<p>4000000000</p>

<h1>cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0073/neo1973-resume.0/resume_reason</h1>

<p>EINT00_ACCEL1
  EINT01_GSM
  EINT02_BLUETOOTH
  EINT03_DEBUGBRD
  EINT04_JACK
  EINT05_WLAN
  EINT06_AUXKEY
  EINT07_HOLDKEY
  EINT08_ACCEL2
* EINT09_PMU
  EINT10_NULL
  EINT11_NULL
  EINT12_GLAMO
  EINT13_NULL
  EINT14_NULL
  EINT15_NULL</p>

<p>So, basically it seems that the phone enables - every second - the rtc timer to make 
it send an interrupt to the CPU. This is not acceptable, of course...</p></markdown-widget>

tries, i unlocked the phone, opened the email app to clear the notification, and
tried one last time. The phone correctly suspended after that.</p>

<p>Network applications will wake the phone up to check their respective data sources,

<p>The calender and alarm apps should wake the phone up until they enter sleep states,
but should not hurt anything else.</p>

<p>I can account for all these wakeups in daily usage, but i still get random wakeups at

<p>Maybe it comes from applications attempting to determine location? (which doesn't

<p>I have not finished my tests yet, but looks like the way to get long-life is to not
use WiFi,GPS and GSM after reboot. You should switch on "Airplane mode" and reboot

<p>Reading through your talk here, and it's gr8 stuff.  Low power mode and battery drain
is a challenge to all vendors, linux, embedded, and otherwise.  Here's an insider's
bit of info though.</p>

<p>I don't feel "uptime" is a valid metric for dealing with the topic you're going
after.  Instead, you should be measuring the current consumption of each component on
your board, and figuring out its contribution to your total current consumption. 
Specifically, you need to know how much your uP consumes at it's highest frequency
rate, it's lowest (e.g. off) and everything in between.  You need to know how much
your modem consumes.  And your RF front end, and everything else.  </p>

<p>You need to break it down, and add everything back up again, to compare against your
actual current drain out of your battery terminals.</p>

<p>anyways, back on topic.</p>

<p>uptime doesn't appear to me to be a valid metric for this topic.</p>

<p><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/proc">http://linux.die.net/man/5/proc</a></p>

<p>/proc/uptime
    This file contains two numbers: the uptime of the system (seconds), and the
amount of time spent in idle process (seconds). </p>

<p>As for measuring current, you create a "loop" for the power supply to each device on
your board.  And you get a current probe, and hook it up to an o-scope, to watch,
over the duration of a period of time (e.g. a slot) and fight each and every little
peak that comes up.</p>

<p>THEN you can work your way down to the ~3mA range that is acceptable for an embedded
hand-held device.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p></markdown-widget>
