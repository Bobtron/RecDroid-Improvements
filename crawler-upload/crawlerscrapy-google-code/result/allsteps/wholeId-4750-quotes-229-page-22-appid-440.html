1. Set up a Google voice account to forward to both your cell number and a SIP number.
2. Register the SIP account in question with cSIPSimple
3. Call your GV number.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>What should happen here is that you should have the choice to answer either via cell phone, or via SIP. At the very least you should be able to configure cSIPSimple to suppress the ringing of either cSIPSimple or Android's native dialer app. Instead, both ring, making it impossible to answer either one. (Phone is too busy trying to play two ringtones, etc.)</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>Motorola Droid (original) running Android 2.2 (Froyo).</p>

<p>This should be handled by introducing either a screen with two buttons labeled "Answer GSM/CDMA" (mine's a CDMA phone) and "Answer SIP", or by adding a new configuration setting "When two calls received simultaneously, assign priority to:", and allow the user to select between SIP and GSM/CDMA.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Not specific to google voice in fact. Can also happen with any other GSM incoming call while SIP incoming call.</p>

<p>I have to test it to reproduce, but google voice is not available in my country (france). Btw, i'll try to solve it when both GSM and SIP call are incoming.
Unfortunately the only i'll be able to do is let the priority to GSM : 
I don't think that an app can control GSM calls.</p></markdown-widget>

It might be possible to use similar code. Regardless, a priority setting in cSIPSimple to default to GSM/CDMA would be much better than the current problem.</p>

<p>Thanks! (I'm enjoying the use of cSIPSimple even with this issue.)</p>

<p>By the way, you can probably sign up for a SIPGate one account (free USA number with incoming calls free) via a US proxy of some kind. If you did that, you could use the SIPGate number to register a Google Voice account. Just a thought.</p>

<p>Alternatively, sign up with PBXes, and add a VOIP account to that.</p></markdown-widget>

I've no google voice account to be able to test this use case precisely. 
However, sounds that if I fix issue 70, this one will be also fixed. 
For now there is absolutely no control about what is the current gsm call state. But I know more or less how to proceed to fix the issue.
I guess that now it should raise on my priority list.... CSipSimple is very young compared to other existing sip software and as it was not really blocking - unless you are using GV with this configuration of course- I postponed this issue. I want to implement things the more cleanly that I can to provide users the best software so to avoid to do something half implemented nothing were done until now.</p>

<p>But you're right, this one and issue 70 should be fixed as soon as possible now =&gt; priority changed to medium on this one and high on issue 70.</p></markdown-widget>

If gsm is ringing and sip incoming =&gt; gsm continues to ring and sip doesn't ring but show the User interface to take the call... You can choose whether you want to use GSM or SIP using the notification toolbar
If SIP is ringing and gsm incoming =&gt; sip stops ringing and gsm ring at his turn. I don't observe any overlap between rings (maybe on devices with low cpu?). So then I get the User interface to take the GSM call... And same thing you can choose with which mean you want to take the call.</p>

<p>If you are in SIP call =&gt; GSM will not ring since I put ringer mode to silent, but the user interface will be shown to allow you to take the call (a nice to have would be to play a little dialtone in csipsimple... but that's not blocking for now).
If you take the GSM call SIP will be put on Hold... when you end your gsm call SIP will be take back.</p>

<p>If you are in GSM call =&gt; SIP will not ring since I read the GSM state before ringing. If you take the SIP call... well you are in a style of conference mode.. really funny... however no technical solution to put GSM on hold... (you should to that by hand, but I guess that's acceptable).</p>

<p>That's what I tested on my Nexus One with my GSM account and one SIP account... trying to make things ring merely at the same time and one little bit delayed from the other... But in all cases works flawlessly.</p>

<p>I guess Google Voice makes rings your GSM account isn't it? If so should be fine with last version...</p>

<p>What you're asking for can't be done with the Droid.  On a CDMA phone like the Droid, as soon as the phone starts ringing for an incoming voice call (1x voice, not SIP), the data network is disconnected, and won't be reconnected until after the phone stops ringing or you complete your call.  Thus it doesn't make any sense to forward your Google Voice to your mobile number and your SIP number: as soon as the voice number begins to ring, you lose your data connection and you no longer have the option of taking the call over SIP.  You must pre-configure your Google Voice to forward to your mobile number <em>or</em> your SIP number - not both.  There's no way to make the decision after a call comes in.  You can also use some kind of call hunting feature from your SIP provider or pbxes.org that can ring one number for so many seconds, and then try a different number if there was no answer on the first number.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Indeed, balazer is absolutely right with his remark (just a little bemol in cdma PS+CS are allowed I think, but you're right for GPRS &amp; Edge ( 2.5 &amp; 2.75 G) ). </p>

<p>The only way you can get your scenario is under a 3G or sup connection or wifi (not Edge nor GPRS, nor everything under 3G) : 
Cause with edge &amp; gprs, when mobile CS (circuit switch) is ongoing (ringing, established), the PS (packet switch) is broken/suspended. 
This mobile ip technologies will make PS &amp; CS exclude each other... 
However, the scenario is still valid for 3G, 3G+, 4G and wifi.</p>

<p>However, I don't really think that anyway preventing from GSM calls to be made is a good idea. </p>

<p>What does it actually change for you if you reply with your GSM or with Wifi?? 
My guess is that it change nothing for incoming call since anyway it comes through google voice servers. 
In this case, it's preferable to use GSM since handover is more reliable than on VoIP and in both case your remote contact will pay his GSM call (or whatever he use to contact you). If you reply with GSM you'll pay nothing (I guess), while if you answer with VoIP you'll maybe (depending of your plan with your carrier) pay for data use .... So even... I think that replying with standard mobile technology could be better for you than using voip...</p>

<p>So maybe if it doesn't "double ring" anymore we can assume the last request about having the choice between sip &amp; gsm for <em>incoming</em> call is useless to implement? All the more so as, once again, I don't think that dropping GSM calls is good for most users (and it's also not the spirit of the android sdk - I would say than on iphone it's even worse : this is just impossible to imagine ;) but, well, that's the other extreme :) ).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your excellent work.  Here is my situation (which I know a few other people, including my wife are also dealing with):</p>

<p>We are almost always near a WiFi network, therefore, we use prepaid GSM SIM cards in our Nexus One's.  Anytime SIP is available (which is almost always for us), we would prefer to take the SIP call since the GSM call will charge us per minute.  I am sure that many with even normal GSM contracts would also like to be able to take SIP in order to save minutes on their plans when possible.  The problem is that with csipsimple, the call arrives via SIP for only ~1 second, then the GSM call interface supercedes it and we are not able to answer via SIP.  </p>

<p>Is there any way to see how Sipdroid is making the SIP interface remain on top of the GSM interface and include this in csipsimple?  If this could be fixed, my wife and I would switch to csipsimple in a heartbeat.  As of now, we have to use Sipdroid in order to be able to answer via SIP when both GSM and SIP are incoming.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>PS. My comment relates closely to furkansahin's suggestion above ("when there is a call, sipdroid suppresses gsm call and sipdroid interface is the only one available for taking the call.").  I just want to give a good reason for why this is desirable for many of us.</p></markdown-widget>

I didn't thought that incoming calls could have been charged by carrier :S.
Well so the request make absolutely sense. 
I'll see what I can do to solve that point. If I found a way it will be an option in settings to "Prefer SIP incoming calls over GSM incoming calls"</p>

<p>Thx for clarification. So, I mark this as accepted, but could take a little bit time to be solved since I don't know what is the state of the android api on this use case.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>One suggestion that might resolve the issue for everyone, while even improving on the way Sipdroid is currently handling things, would be the following:</p>

<p>Since the Android dialer cannot be dismissed without declining the call, what if:
1- Csipsimple comes to the front when a simultaneous SIP &amp; GSM calls are received.  Thus, the GSM dialer would continue to run in the background, but will not visible because csipsimple has taken the focus
2- For those who want to take the call over GSM, we add a button to the csipsimple interface that simply dismisses the csipsimple window, allowing the native (/GSM) dialer to again come to the forefront.</p>

<p>Just an idea...</p></markdown-widget>

<p>sterling, I can offer one possible work-around:  install Tasker and the Locale Google Voice Set Plug. Configure Tasker with the plug-in to enable forwarding of your Google Voice calls to your mobile number when WiFi disconnects, and to disable forwarding when WiFi connects.  Naturally you will need some kind of mobile data connection for this to work.  So either get used to T-Mobile's prepaid data offerings, or switch to AT&amp;T prepaid, which is not so bad after they lowered the per-minute voice rate to $0.10.  Install Droidwall to keep your mobile data usage low.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>balazar, thanks for your suggestion.  Sipdroid has never had any trouble taking priority when a call comes in over both GSM and SIP on any of the phones/OS's that I've tested.  As long as Sipdroid is registered, the Sipdroid window remains reliably on top of the native dialer.  If you are having trouble, check the SIP service you're dialed into (pbxes, gizmo5, etc); in some cases, the server will stop ringing after only a couple of rings and you will be back to the native dialer.  As long as the SIP server continues to ring your account and Sipdroid is registered, Sipdroid will maintain priority focus over the native dialer.</p>

<p>A few details in case it's helpful:
Phones tested: G1 and Nexus One (x2)
OS's tested: Donut, Eclair, Froyo
Result: As long as Sipdroid is registered (wifi connected or data available), the Sipdroid dialer block will be available and supercede the native dialer.</p>

<p>You can read about Sipdroid's implementation here under the heading "How Are Buttons Assigned?": <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/wiki/FAQ">http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/wiki/FAQ</a></p></markdown-widget>
