1. Start CSipSimple.
2. Disable all accounts (including "Local")
3. Try to start other SIP server or try to call to this host.</p>

<p>What is the expected output? 
Other SIP server starts and binds to 5060; calls to this host fails; CSipSimple is actually off.</p>

<p>What do you see instead?
Other SIP server tells "Can't bind to 5060"; can call to CSipSimple; CSipSimple is on even though there are no "active" accounts.</p>

r1723 and r1501 for Android</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the report !
There is indeed one thing to fix (a regression), since the application should turn off sip stack when application is quit and has no accounts active anymore.</p>

<p>However, the fact that the app is still reachable on port defined in Network &gt; local port to bind configuration is not a problem. 
And your last sentence is not really what you should expect ;)
Let me explain :
A sip <em>client</em> (uac), will bind a local port to transport SIP packets (and receive SIP packets from servers). 
It's independent on the fact you have or not local account configured and is needed even for distant accounts. And the fact it listen on the port doesn't means it's a "server" (or if so, all sip clients are servers ;) ), it just means that it's reachable on this port.</p>

<p>BTW, a local account is just something virtual since there is always a local account actually in a UAC, and that's not specific to CSipSimple : just try on your desktop preferred client not configured for local account, you'll see it probably listen on port 5060. Just try with twinkle for example : even if you use a distant account a "netstat -tupan | grep 5060" will show you two listening sockets on port 5060.</p>

<p>By default in CSipSimple it will listen on a random port (when in network settings you configure to 0 UDP/TCP port). This port is automatically changed when you create a local account to 5060 (because it's easier for others to reach you in this case).</p>

<p>This transport port always exists and is shared by all accounts (it's not related to local account). That's why local udp/tcp port are in Global settings in the network section and not in each account configuration. It's something global and just about the fact the sip stack is running or not (it has nothing to do with accounts from a sip stack point of view). </p>

<p>So CSipSimple is not expected to listen on 5060 <em>only</em> when local account is activated but it's expected to listen on the configured port as long as the sip stack is running. Because all accounts will need this port to be bound.
And the configured port of global settings is your case 5060 because you created one local account, but you can revert it to 0 manually. </p>

<p>To be cover all the issue, I would also say that there is another possible approach (that is not used by any client I know for good reason, but that would be feasible). Pjsip (the sip stack behind csipsimple) allows to create several local transport bindings. So it would be theoretically possible to create one transport per account. However, in terms of performance that's a very bad idea, and even worse for a mobile. That's why in CSipSimple and in most SIP client you'll find the transport is shared by all accounts and created only once (and started/stopped with the stack regardless the number of accounts on the top of it).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Not sure that we have same definition of the local account so :).</p>

<p>By "local" account I mean the one using the Local wizard. This one is a fake representation of the transport used by CSipSimple.</p>

<p>Apparently in your case there is a real SIP server running on your phone. In this case, it's not a local account (local to the application) that you need; but an account that connects your server (hosted on the same device, but from the application point of view it's remote). So from the application point of view, it's not "local" ;).</p>

<p>So, in your case, you should <em>not</em> create your account using local wizard and you don't need one if you have a sip server already hosted on localhost.
If you create a "local" account (with my meaning of local), it will switch the app to port 5060 bound locally. Which you don't want since there is your server running on that port. 
So, use "0" as local port bound in UDP/TCP global network parameters instead. </p>

<p>
I don't want to have some fallback mechanism else you'll never know where you are bound. While having 0 is clearly random and having a fix port ensure you to be reachable on this port.
</p>

<p>In your case, rather than a "local" account (with local wizard), you need a regular account that uses as server 127.0.0.1 . You can use basic wizard for that. Local is very very particular and I think that's not the "local" you expected ;). It's some wizard that is local to application.</p></markdown-widget>
