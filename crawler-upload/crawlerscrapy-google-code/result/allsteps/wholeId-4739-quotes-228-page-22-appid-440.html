<p>Don't really know if it will be in the beta release (the application is still an alpha version). Seems not so easy to implement in order to be compatible with 1.5 to 2.2 devices. So will maybe not in the scope of the first stable release.</p>

<p>If so the button will not be present. The bluetooth button and the add call button too will be probably deleted/deactivated since not in the scope of the first stable release.</p>

The big issue is to succeed in doing something backward compatible (even if feature is not present on 1.5, 1.6 and 2.0).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the dalvik doesn't really allow to make things dynamically and it's a little bit complex to wrap new methods into something that doesn't crash at running time on older OS. But that's possible.</p>

<p>As I previously said, for me that's not yet a priority. 
The first reason is that I have still a lot of work to do on the rest of the app.
The second reason is that I have no bluetooth devices (so it will be hard to test for me).</p>

<p>But... If anybody is interesting in developing this part of the soft, he is welcome. It's an opensource project !! :).
If nobody take this point before the first stable release, I'll take it and implement something.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I have an extra headset i found i could definitely drop in the post.
Also could you please upgrade the feature request priority to [High] .</p>

<p>It is a enhancement request after all with its own tag. Can't think of any other feature people are outcrying more for than this right now in a SIP client.
The fing feature request thread speaks volumes.</p>

<p>www.fring.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15877</p>

<p>Also i've been doing some testing on different SIP and softphone apps, i did come across one that is able to use the stereo bluetooth features of a bluetooth headset.
Its called Tubaloo but the quality was down right horrible and i had constant audio dropout on both sides.</p>

<p>I'm starting to wonder if this is even possible :(</p></markdown-widget>

This is not a blocking feature. 
There is other people for how the application doesn't work at all. And theses issues has to be fixed before.
An important thing is that csipsimple is still an <em>alpha</em> version!!! Keep this in mind!!! It's developped by 3 people on their own time and I think that an issue about the use of an extra device is not a blocking issue for the beta release. </p>

<p>I consider this as a nice to have <em>for</em> the beta release. But can be postponed for next versions. If you work all your nights, week ends and holidays on an opensource project, you'll understand that my first goal is to release something <em>stable</em> and useable for a <em>daily use</em> for all users. </p>

<p>Though, this request is absolutely technically reachable. I've not time to take this point right now. 
Micheal has just committed a great improvement that allow to take call with a Bluetooth handset and he will maybe continue on this issue. 
So there is chance that this issue will be fixed before beta. But considering the overall project, this is is not a high priority feature.</p>

<p>So keep in touch of what is happening here. And if you have coding skills, you can contribute to the project (it is opensource &amp; GPL!), you'll be welcome ;).</p></markdown-widget>

But to perform that, I need to refactor the way audio routes are established.
In fact, android can't re-route a audio track in streaming mode to bluetooth. So audio track has to be stopped and then re-run. This implies a lot of refactoring in my code. Besides in order to not break things for 2.1 and lower, wrapper class has to be done.</p>

<p>1 - There is absolutely no impact on CPU! Why Bluetooth implementation could have an impact?</p>

<p>2 - Why do you want me to fork the project I started???? It makes no sens.</p>

<p>3 - CSipSimple build 0.00-12-07 is available for download : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-07.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-07.apk</a>
Be aware of the fact bluetooth is available only for android 2.2 and for bluetooth SCO devices. You'll need to force audio frequency to 8kHz (if changed from the settings) : not yet tested using 16kHz audio but SDK reference announce that bluetooth SCO stream only allow mono+8kHz.</p>

<p>Another point about this last version, Bluetooth don't automatically activate itself since detection of the presence of the device is not yet done. Todo later (seems not really simple to do sco api is poor).
Same thing with the Bluetooth take call button. I have a work around to manage it but it's not enough good to be integrated.</p>

<p>I'll see later for back-porting to 2.1 and lower. And then to A2DP bluetooth devices.</p></markdown-widget>

For now all codecs are activated by default but once we will be able to do enough tests on many device csipsimple will automatically configure what codec is available on each device.</p>

<p>I also own a htc magic (still left in android 1.5 in order to test backward compatibility) and I make a lot of tests on it.
To make things work properly, I found out that forcing the use of PCMU or PCMA (by disabling all othre codecs in Option&gt;Media&gt;Codec &amp; long press in each unwanted codec &gt; Disable ); forcing 8kHz audio, disabling voice auto detection and disabling echo cancellation; make things working properly. </p>

<p>The reason is that some codecs such as Speex for example consume a lot of CPU (for the codec topic, yes, CPU is a big deal).
Besides since builds I provide on the googlecode download section are debuggable and produce a lot of log. It also impact the performance on old devices.</p>

<p>Last point that can deeply impact performances is of course the network bandwidth.</p>

<p>For my tests on my HTC magic I use wifi, PCMU(or A)@8kHz without VAD and without echo cancellation.</p>

<p>Two question :
Is voice path (even if choppy) is well switched to your Bluetooth device?
I didn't know that htc released officialy froyo for G2 ! I though that last week it was an update for the HTC Desire. I'm really interested in their last update. Have you an url link for this update?</p></markdown-widget>

As for the update, it was given out to a select pool of MT3G 1.2 and slide users.
HTC and Tmobile are actively sending out this update as of june 11th.
I'll try and package it up (pull the files using adb) and put them up somewhere.</p>

Do you know what codec is in use when you are in call? (use the (i)nfo button to show information about current call).
I hope this is not a consequence of the Froyo update... on my device (remained in 1.5....) sound quality is pretty good on my tests. I probably should try with a cynanogen rom to see what is the impact of newer os version on the app.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>First thank you for the great works in the last couple of weeks.
I've got to be subjective however, i'm really disappointed bluetooth is once again been given a back seat in development. I look at a LOT of non android devices with similar (if not the same) broadcom chipsets and the have more than made their bluetooth integration smooth and seamless. Which is not to say we can't get there.</p>

<p>It almost feels like being caught in a innovative paradox.</p>

<p>Its my esteemed hope bluetooth can be given a front seat in development with not just cSip but with other mainstream beta/alpha apps as well.</p>

<p>BEST
David</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As for Trillian developper... CSipSimple code is under GPLv3. As trillian is not opensource (as far as I know), legaly, they must not include parts of my code or derivated work of my code (unless they change their licence to a gplv3 compatible one). 
But... I can bear it if they redistribute what they change and provide the community something more reliable.

How do you want me to support Bluetooth if even the standard app doesn't support BT??? It clearly appear that the ROM doesn't support Bluetooth (as far as I can say SCO bluetooth) well.

It was supported since Cupcake version but only in the phone application (they use private API that a standard application dev should not use). For bluetooth a2dp, I have no device to test on. There is some method available on the android API that should manage that from 1.5 or 1.6 but if it behaves like bluetooth sco things will be more complicated.
Besides as cyanogen is not stable with bluetooth connections, I fear that even if I support BT a2dp, it will not solve your problem. </p></markdown-widget>

Reporter is the owner of the sipdroid project.
I added a comment, and after investigation :
* I have a workaround for csipsimple (will be in -12-24) the backside is that you'll ear some blank sound in the headset even once disconnected - but at least it will not "reboot" (in fact it restart only some services but you get the boot screen) once headset or BT is disconnected + by default for now deactivate BT, user must click to activate it if he want.
* I'll probably commit something on the android project to fix the issue definitely on the android side (if android devs doesn't take my comment into account... commit process in android is faster - I've already contributed a minor update for the music app and took about 2 weeks to be validated).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well for now i have found a bearable alternative.
It seems linphone found a workaround inside the bluetooth stacks to get bluetooth bearably working on older devices. They are using some kind of odd service hacks. The main thing i noticed with their app is&gt; that it doesn't do any debugging or logging or anything fancy at all. It simply connects and runs.  It must chew through battery life like a monster however. I also noticed it keeps a constant connection and does some weird things with pulseaudio in the background.</p>

<p>So for the time being the only option we (D/S users) have is.</p>

<p>Linphone + Lite rom + a decent headset + a good wifi connection (2.5/3 Bars) + pcmu or pcma or other lite 8khz codec + pbxes sip optimization .
This will let you call the office in a pinch and let them know you're going to be late. I wouldn't use it to make intimate calls however, you would without a doubt come across looking like a jerk.</p>

<p>I wish i could report back better news.  Even with my own tinkering around in the source i haven't been able to scrub the intermittent audio issues.</p>

<p>We either need a super lite codec or tighter bond between the bluetooth stack and the headset. Which would be up to google to fix in AOSP</p></markdown-widget>

On my modest Samsung Galaxy Mini, I am able to hear the voice on the other end in an outgoing call on my modest bluetooth headset with A2DP but they are not able to hear my voice. It works however if I use the phone's built in dialer (thus bypassing SIP) . My phone is on Froyo .. Kernel is 2.6.32.9 .. Csipsimple version is r615 .. Let me know if I could help you more in this regard. I tried Linphone 1.1.4 and it works (ppl can hear my creepy voice) but the quality is poor and I really dont feel at home using that software ...</p>

If you don't want to wait for the nightly build, you can simply use audio troubleshoting workarounds and set Audio mode to MODE_NORMAL (instead of MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION), and it will solve the problem.</p></markdown-widget>

Why Android can correctly pick the bluetooth microphone during phone calls, but not CSipSimple? By the way, my audio mode has always been set to normal.

Third party apps has to ask the telephony app to share its own connection with the bluetooth SCO headset... and some manufacturer did crappy things there. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, a third party application is not a core application. There is much more abstracted layer between a third party application and the core Telephony app. The core telephony app directly talk with the headset and establish raw connection with it.
A third party app has to ask using the API (that finally ask the Telephony application as far as I can tell after reading the android source code), to stream its own audio to the connection that was established between the Telephony app and the headset.</p>

<p>The audio layer in android is really not done to perform voip (start to be after android 2.3 cause google was needing it to provide their stock SIP application). But users has to be aware about that. 
Streaming audio for input/output is something that is not well supported by the android system before 2.3. Latency is high, I have to do hacks for each manufacturers to have the correct routing (and even for standard routing - earpiece - mic - spearker...).
And that's just about the way each manufacturer implement things.
So just imagine ... Bluetooth SCO that is managed by another app which is highly dependent of the GSM chipset...
If where Bluetooth AD2P would have been by far easier cause this is managed at android OS level... but problem ... no micro on Bluetooth AD2P :S.</p>

<p>So try to be indulgent with this kind of problem. I really do my best to support as much device as possible, but keep in mind that just not plug and record... That's plenty of hacks.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>About update, nightly and market version are compatible with each other (I sign with the same key). I think that downloading from the market should be equivalent that downloading from the nightly repo (unless google market does things in the middle). So you can try to upgrade to market version, the only risk is that it refuse to install ;).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I think this works because Bria (rymes with inferior :-) doesnt have bluetooth support and the audio is simply hijacked by the bluetooth.</p>

<p>If so it would explain, what you observe : in fact when you use an AD2P device, nothing has to be done to route the audio.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, since CSipSimple tries to do things to activate the SCO mode of your BT device (and grab the micro that is not available on AD2P).
On AD2P quality should be by far better (obviously AD2P is stereo and 16kHz ;)... but has no micro capture feature ;) ).</p>

<p>I could try to add an option to "do nothing with BT" so that it would run the same way than apps that does not try to support BT. (It was what was previously done by CSipSimple before BT was added ;) ... )</p></markdown-widget>

Ultimately it would be good to get BT working, of course, but this is a good alternative for now.</p>

<p>Just a wee note though...With this method, the call, be it incomming or outgoing, will not silence your music or radio. You have to manually switch the car stereo to BT audio (as if you were playing MP3 for example) and then you get the audio.  But hey it works.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I still need to manually switch my car stereo to "AUX" but that is no biggie.  Regular cell calls will mute the car stereo and switch to Bluetooth audio automatically, which is nice, but you just have to remember to do this manually when receiving a call on csipsimple.</p>

I have to admit, last versions are really very stable. I am using it as my main phone at the moment. Thanks for your work. 
The only problem, I have is this BT &lt;-&gt; Car BT system issue. I have strange results.
1. It works perfectly well with my Jabra BT3030 stereo head set.
2. it works perfectly well with my NaviHeaven car stereo system nin one of my cars, in Phone calls and listening to audio from the phone (same as with my Jabra headset).
3. no audio on both sides of the call with my Mini (car) audio system with BT built in.
4. no audio on both sides with my friend's Mercedes audio system with BT built in.</p>

<p>NaviHeaven is an after market car audio (Chinese) installed in my other car. It has all possible features and works perfectly with both, standard phone app in my Galaxy S II as well as cSS installed in the same phone. 
My Galaxy works on Gingerbread 2.3.3 XXKF2 version.</p></markdown-widget>

Recently I have upgraded my phone (Sonyercisson Xperia X10) to Android 2.3.3, and I was hoping that the bluetooth support will work for the application.
Although the button no longer is grayed and I am able to enable the feature, there is no sound at all. The strange thing is that as long as I have bluetooth enabled on my phone, there is no sound at all not even over the mic and speaker of the phone, or even the loudspeaker. 
Is there something I am missing in terms of configuration, or it is just an incompatibility with my phone?</p></markdown-widget>

I just have come to new experience.
I have made some tests with my to cars, Smart with NaviHavean radio with BT including stereo audio transmission and my Mini with its Mini + navigation +BT (without stereo audio transmission).
I have noticed that I can make a call from CSS on my Galaxy in Smart when radio is set to Phone screen only. If I am on radio screen (listening to radio) and I try to initiate a call from CSS: no way. When I do it using standard phone feature in my Galaxy, it is OK.
So I have made similar test in my Mini. I have initiated a call from the list off numbers shown in the Mini radio (downloaded from my phone by BT). Then the standard page giving an option to select the app to make a call was shown in the phone, so I've selected CSS, than the call was established and I could communicate through Mini BT feature, but only for few seconds. Then the call was disconnected and the Radio has shown an info: "Call end".
This suggests, that Radio in Mini waites for some confirmation of the call being established and while not receiving it, the call is disconnected.
I wonder if this can help you in resolving this issue. If you need any more help or tests or whatever, just let me know.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I am using a Jabra BT320s stereo BT headset with my Acer Iconia Tab A501 with Android 3.0.1 (Kernel 2.6.36.3. I prefer CSipSimple over SipDroid due to the much better sound quality. However on CSipSimple I do not get any sound on my BT headset, while it works with SipDroid.
May be, a peak in the SipDroid code can help you to find the missing link?
Keep up the good work.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Did a little more messing around with settings in Expert mode to see if I could get audio over bluetooth working. By changing "Audio Mode for SIP calls" from "IN_COMMUNICATION" to "NORMAL", I can get the speaker to work, but the microphone still does not register. I've tested every available mic source option in Expert mode, as well as toggling and mixing all possible combinations of "Echo Cancellation", "Use WebRTC Implementation", "Use routing API", "Use Mode audio API" and "Use Samsung Galaxy Hack" and "Tone Hack" without any success.</p>

<p>Interestingly, microphone source also seems to effect how well the bluetooth earpiece speaker is able to function, at least when audio mode "NORMAL" is selected. "VOICE_CALL" mic source seems to be the only choice that will allow for a completely smooth listening experience. Any of the others usually cause a loss of earpiece speaker audio after just a few seconds into a call, or no audio at all.</p>

<p>Attached is a log file for a phone call attempted to FedEx with bluetooth headset on and paired. Audio mode "NORMAL" and mic source "VOICE_CALL". Only "echo cancellation" and "focus audio" were toggled on from the main media menu of options.</p></markdown-widget>

In my scenario the MIC was always routed to the tablet, never to the headset (even with adjustments in advanced for mic source). It seems the headset was connected to CSS via the media path not the headset path. This is not a CSS problem, the carrier has restricted the use of the headset profile on this model. I have found in '/system/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf' my carrier (TMO) has disabled all but the A2DP profile. No matter what I have tried I was unable to get Bluetooth via CSS working until I enabled the other profiles (will require root) and rebooted. Additionally, I have also found that if you enter the settings menu on CSS the bluetooth MIC stops routing to the headset (even if you don't edit anything), and returns back to the media routing profile only. The bluetooth button is greyed out as well, until you force close CSS and restart it.  Then after the force close, CSS resumes using the headset again under the correct headset BT profile. I can re-create this every time. Build r1629.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>About a heavily distorted audio when using BT: The workaround in post #51 worked well for only the first call after setting SIP Audio mode to NORMAL (instead of IN_COMMUNICATION). The next call would also have a seriously distorted sound and the only way to correct it is by redoing the workaround.</p>

What happens if you try (with version 1743 or upper):
 Go in settings, press menu key and enable expert mode
 Then go in media section, and in audio troubleshooting subsection (latest one).
 Then in the Audio implementation option choose the "Java" one instead of the "OpenSL-ES" one.
?</p>

<p>I'll review changes between r1742 and r1743 (it was a change inside opensl-es implementation). Many thanks for this feedback.</p></markdown-widget>

When I am listening to music via my BT headset (LG HBS700, I believe this is A2DP) and a call comes in via CSIP Simple the audio stops playing, and the only way I have found to get audio working through Bluetooth again is by rebooting both the phone and headset.</p>

<p>While it would be nice to use my headset for calls with CSIP, it isn't essential.  But it would be great if I could at least get it to not interfere with the existing playing audio.  I have tried both checking and unchecking auto connect bluetooth, and have the same behavior both ways.  I have not seen any other obvious setting to change.  I am using a Galaxy Note 2 with 4.1.1.</p>

<p>Appreciate any help that can be given.  CSIP Simple is really an excellent client in all other ways.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Im running the current latest nightly build (0.04-05 r2201), after previously trying the market version, on a Samsung Galaxy S3 running OS 4.2.2.</p>

<p>I have csimple working fine through the phone, but not through bluetooth. While standard calls through the phone app work as expected with my bluetooth headset, and while csipsimple will switch correctly either manually or automatically to the bluetooth headset, there is no audio in the bluetooth earpiece. Looking at the in call monitoring pop-up while connected to bluetooth, I can see received audio (but not hear it) but the bluetooth mic seems to be registering no audio.</p>

<p>Switching back to the phone or phone speaker confirms the audio is there, as does the in-call monitoring (so both speaker and mic bars show audio is detected, as opposed to on bluetooth when only received audio is detected, but not heard.)</p>

<p>I have been through the troubleshooting, inclusive of reset to defaults, and followed the suggested steps with no apparent change to the symptoms, excepting for the audio mode setting. When this is set to "in-call" I can hear about a second of clear received audio in the bluetooth headset when I manually connect to it during a call, and then the headset goes quiet. Its quite possible the bluetooth mic also works for at this time, its too brief to test effectively though. The headset isnt disconnecting, and remains in this state until I manually switch back to the phone, when normal two way audio is resumed.</p>

<p>The other suggestions in the troubleshooting appear to make no difference, including routing API, WebRTC, and also trying samsung galaxy hack, tone hack and focus audio and others makes no difference. Only the in-call setting takes me from no bluetooth audio to one second of audio.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I am using CSipSimple for a long time and quite impressed with it. I am all good with this app except that BT feature does not function correctly on my device. I would love to see the BT feature coming through for this app.</p>

<p>I am currently using Samsung Galaxy S4 (jfltetmo) currently running on CM 11-m9 (android v4.4.4). I use the LG HBS730 bluetooth headset with this phone. This headset bluetooth profile is: V3.0+EDR bluetooth protocol support HSP, HFP, A2DP and AVRCP/Handfree, aptX® Compatible.</p>

<p>After pairing the headset, whenever I try to place call using CSipSimpple, the app crashes saying "Unfortunately, the CSipSimple has stopped".</p>

<p>I grabbed the log messages and would want to attach them here but there is a note below this textarea saying "Issue attachment storage quota exceeded". Is there any alternative to post the logs? </p>

<p>Also, I sent the logs to developers [at] csipsimple dot com.</p>

<p>Couple of questions after going through some of the discussions on this page:
1. Does it mean that CSipSimple works only with BT headsets having BT SCO?
2. Is BT SCO is an underlying profile supported by all headsets in general?
3. Is there something different to be done for CSipSimple app in order to work with BT headsets supporting A2DP and AVRCP protocols?
4. Is there a workaround to make this app work with BT headsets having A2DP/AVRCP protocols?</p>

<p>Hi, </p>

<p>I appreciate your lead regarding the Mono bluetooth router.</p>

<p>Did this help in getting CSipSimple to work in routing the audio through the BT headset eventhough the BT headset is not just mono but compatible with A2DP/AVRCP protocols? Or is your headset just a mono bluetooth headset?</p>

<p>Your reply would help in this matter.</p></markdown-widget>
