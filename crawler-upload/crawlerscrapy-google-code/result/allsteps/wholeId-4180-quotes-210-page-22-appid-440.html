                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is a missing feature in CSipSimple.</p>

<p>In fact priority is an indication given by csipsimple in the SDP.</p>

<p>In fact it is the way SIP works :
When you "invite" somebody you send to him your own codec priority list.
Then the other compare with what he support and choose the first supported codec in your priority list.</p>

<p>As consequence for outgoing calls you send the invite so the server on the other side take the first supported codec in your list.
On the other side when you receive a call CSipSimple acts the same standard behavior. It take the first supported codec in the top of the priority list of the other side.</p>

<p>So what you observe is absolutely logic and it is not a bug.</p>

<p>However the missing feature is to say to have an option to "force" codec choice according to our priority list. I have not done that yet cause it should be done in the SIP stack (CSipSimple use pjsip as sip stack), and the sip stack does not support that AFAIK.</p>

<p>So accepted as enhancement (I had already that on my todo list but good to have an issue to track that).</p>

<p>However meanwhile, as you know exactly what you server support you can simply disable the PCMU/A codec. It will ensure that it will not be choosen by CSipSimple for incoming (long press on codec row to disable codec).
However the bad side of that is that if somebody from another server call you directly (without using the media gateway feature of your sip server the call may fail if the other side does not support remaining codecs).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>For codec efficiency it depends on many many things : the CPU power and arch (support floating point or not), bandwidth available, options such as voice detection and echo cancellation, it may also depend on the audio driver available on your phone.</p>

<p>So a little bit hard to give advise in the absolute :).
There is some intersting charts over the web. For example : <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/support/broadvoice/codec_comparison.php">http://www.broadcom.com/support/broadvoice/codec_comparison.php</a>
But there is a lot of others. Some focusing on voice quality, others on bandwidth... (If bandwidth is important and your network does not support such a bandwidth quality rapidly decrease).</p>

<p>Most of these charts does not include the recently released codec from Skype (named SILK) that is now included in CSipSimple (nightly builds). It's an interesting codec cause support low bandwidth when 8kHz and high quality when 24kHz.</p>

<p>Last point about g729, remember that's a codec that use is restricted to a proprietary license. I do not distribute this license (I distribute only an opensource application). I included g729 cause of pressure of users that need this codec cause their SIP provider already pay a license for them to use that. But I'd advise to use iLBC instead cause it's a true opensource codec.</p>

<p>Just last point about your initial issue. After replying I search a little bit more in pjsip source if there were no quick way to provide such an option and found something interesting. There is a static option (I mean that user can not change in the application but that can be changed when I build the application), that should allow to prefer our codec priorities instead of remote codec priorities. </p>

<p>So in a first time could be possible to activate that. </p>

<p>That would make more sense for users than the current default behavior. Then I'll try to add that as an option that can be changed by users.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>If yes maybe could be interesting to produce logs. But usually when you have this situation it means that invite from the other side does contains no codecs activated on our side.</p>

<p>Also some important point. When gizmo5 say "we support" this codecs, it could be true only for SIP to SIP calls. And when calls comes/goes to a PSTN gateway restrict that to only PCMU.
Also could depend on the way we are asking gizmo5 but sometimes SIP to SIP can use media gateway of the server if the server restrict possible codecs. Usually when you do SIP to SIP calls without using any media gateway you should be able to use all codecs, even those not supported by the SIP server.</p></markdown-widget>
