<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
See the numeric password being type in the shell window. The voicemail prompt seems to timeout waiting for input and the are no dtmf enties in log file.</p>

Downloaded nightly build issues April 4, 2011.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I am currently testing this on a xoom. I am unable to send any dtmf into my asterisk server running pbxinaflash (1.7.5.5), freepbx (2.6.03), asterisk (1.4.21.2)on centos server.</p>

<p>dtmf mode is set to rfc2833 on asterisk extension (sip_additional.conf) and set to auto in  csipsimple. I have also tries it set to rtp in csipsimple.

<p>I don't think that RTP recv errors are linked to the dtmf problem. (but that's just a guess).
Usually that just cause the server is talking with a codec that is not the one chosen by the SDP negociation. That's cause pjsip only support one codec at a time but that's not hurting since they finally force the codec to use if the server announce multiple codecs.
But anyway telephony RTP packets are treated as separate flow. So should not be a problem. At least that's errors I usually get but that are just here at the beggining of the come while the server is not yet aware about the fact the client has made a choose on the codec to use for audio. (unless you get one RTP recv() error each time you send a dtmf tone that would mean server is trying to reply us using non 101 payload type, but I don't think so)</p>

<p>rfc 2833 (aka RTP events mode) should be a good choice. It is supported by pjsip (the sip stack csipsimple rely on). 
Logs seems to send it correctly and usually when it does not try to fallback to tone generation (in band generation) it means that the other part is fine with RTP packet.</p>

<p>However sometimes, when there is multiple media gateways between you and the final machine that should receive the RTP payloads, one gateway can drop RTP telephony events.
I guess other sip phones works with your configuration, but usually most sip phones use by default tone generation. It's the most robust way (less clean but more robust). So it could be interesting in CSipSimple to force the "In band generation" mode. I think that asterisk is able to manage it too.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The only way to get tones to work with Xoom is to disable Voice Audio Detection, and force Dialing Tone Feedback. I use GVoice + Sipgate, so all my calls are incoming. After receiving the call from GVoice, you MUST open the keypad and dial a number so that the Tone Feedback starts. If you try dialing after the call is connected, the tone feedback WILL NOT WORK. Also, if you change any volume settings tone feedback will not work for the remainder of the call. I've had calls where I get halfway through an automated menu and accidentally change the volume, which means I have to restart the call!</p>

<p>So! If you can successfully get dial tone feedback in-call using the keypad (which is sometimes impossible for certain numbers), you can navigate automated menus. This works because the microphone and speaker are right next to each other on the Xoom, so the tone coming out from the speaker is recorded by the mic. This works MUCH better if you hold your figer over the left speaker as you dial (right speaker when viewed from the back).</p>

<p>It's kind of a silly hack, but the only way I've been able to get 'DTMF' to work. Oh yeah, using external tone generators doesn't work either because CSipSimple locks the audio stream. I've tried many different settings with no success in allowing tone generators to output audio.</p>

<p>Please look into resolving DTMF issues for Xoom. Even without DTMF, menu navigation would be much easier if Dial Tone Feedback worked properly. I'm surprised that the software doesn't generate the tone directly into the input stream, like generating an audio sequence into the mic instead of the speaker. ;)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Normally if you choose In band generation mode for DTMF mode it will generate a tone directly to the stream. (Not sure it bypass VAD however).
If you choose auto, it will start trying to send over RTP. If it does not work it will fallback to in band generation mode.
Usually the problem is there : many sip provider said to support RTP tones, while they actually do nothing with that and just drop the RTP packet... In this case you have to force the in band generation.</p>

<p>I'll do an extra check on this point to be really sure in band generation works properly in pjsip but when I did a lot of tests on these 3 modes all was working properly. </p></markdown-widget>

It's available as r 1356 here : <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a></p>

<p>If my analysis is correct, it is a potential bug in Xoom that doesn't correctly convert key code to char. Normally there is some Keymap tool in android that should allow to transform key code to char. This is the clean way to do that and normally allow to treat the same way virtual keyboard and a real keyboard. 
But apparently, if all keys you press produce the same signal, this is probably the root cause of the problem.
So I just did a fix by coding my own mapping for 0-9, # and * chars (others chars will fallback to clean keymap method, but since the ui doesn't allow to type others should not be a problem for the xoom).</p>

<p>If one of you can test the nightly build and tell me if it helps.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I was far to think Xoom could be "buggy" on that. All the more so as, as far as I understood it was done with google engineers. 
But well, since it was the first with honeycomb, maybe they did the ROM a little bit too quickly and didn't integrate the digit keymap (which may break other apps).</p>

<p>As you said, it was breaking all DTMF modes -- since was about how the user interface transform a keypress into a digit to send --, so this revision should fix the problem for all Xoom owners whatever the DTMF mode required/supported on their server (not only the SIP INFO mode).</p></markdown-widget>
