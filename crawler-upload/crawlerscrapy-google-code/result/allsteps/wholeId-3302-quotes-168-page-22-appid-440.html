                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b></p>

<p>The following steps apply to the Galaxy Note, probably other Samsung Galaxy variants, and perhaps even models from other brands:
1. Setup an active and working bluetooth headset on your phone.
2. Install CSipSimple (I'm pretty sure any version will do, market or nightly).
3. Make sure integration with the native dialer is enabled in settings (it should be enabled by default).
4. Make sure your bluetooth headset is working with CSipSimple for both placing <em>and</em> receiving calls. In necessary, enable Expert Settings Mode in Settings and select the right combination of routing, audio mode and microphone source to get your device working. (For the Galaxy Note, audio mode = "NORMAL", mic source = "MIC" or "DEFAULT" and Samsung Galaxy Hack enabled).
5. Download and install DW Dialer from the market to replace the stock dialer. Set it as the default dialer app.
6. Reboot your phone and make sure CSS registers at least one SIP account at startup.
5. Place a test call from either CSS or the non-stock dialer app, doesn't matter which. This call should work through the bluetooth headset.
6. Now arrange to receive a call from a friend or use wheresmycellphone.com to call your phone. It doesn't matter whether your mobile number or SIP number is used.
7. Experience the incoming call without audio.
8. Reboot phone. Uninstall DW Dialer. Make sure stock dialer is now default.
9. Reboot once more. Place and receive calls using bluetooth using your SIP account or your mobile number and everything works normally.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>I expect to be able to answer the incoming call from the phone or headset and have both speaker and microphone work on the headset and on the phone. Instead, audio to/from the headset and also the phone's earpiece and loudspeaker is not present. From that point onward, only a reboot of the phone will fix bluetooth.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>CSS: The last 2 stable versions in the market, and all the latest nightlies for the past month or so up to today (v1235). 
Phone: Gingerbread 2.3.6 - Samsung Stock LA4 ROM and CF-Root LA4 Kernel (stock kernel w/ root, busybox, clockworkmod and some custom boot scripts: ie, nothing that I believe should effect CSS's bluetooth functionality)</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>As you can see from the last couple posts I made to Issue 51, I spent a lot of time and energy trying every combination of audio mode, mic source and routing options to solve what I thought was just an issue with the Galaxy Note's audio driver implementation. But it appears that CSS doesn't play well with non-stock dialers I would assume especially when set to be integrated to the stock dialer itself, which is being suppressed.</p>

<p>Would you be able to shed any light on this Regis? I suppose I could include a log file if you need it. I haven't tried other non-stock dialers, as I am so thrilled right now that bluetooth is working for <em>ALL</em> calls to my device that I don't want to risk ruining my working setup right now. ;)</p></markdown-widget>

EDIT 2: In step 5 (part II) where you place a test call from CSS or DW Dialer, you have to elect to use CSS ultimately for the call. It must be a call over SIP or it won't create the proper conditions for the rest of the steps. </p></markdown-widget>

In fact in android code it's the telephony app that hold the SCO bluetooth connection.</p>

<p>So indeed it really depends on how the manufacturer changed the android source code or the stock dialer app.
In case of a buggy telephony app, unfortunately, nothing can be done by csipsimple. Also in case of another app (dialer for example), buggy that keep BT SCO connection, it will be buggy.
There were also some bug on a previous android version (on stock telephony app).</p>

<p>In fact, what usually confuse people is that they compare with music application that can use A2DP BT profile. This profile only allow to stream from device to BT headset. So the app has to use the SCO profile. And this one is managed by the stock telephony app on android.
It also means that the BT connection is shared with all other applications. 
So if one app take a connection to BT telephony app, and does not release it, no other app will be able to take BT SCO connection. Normally csipsimple release this connection as soon as the phone call ends.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Thanks very much for the response, indeed your logic does make sense, even to the limited amount of understanding I have about what's going on at the system level. If the non-stock dialer (and as you said, any dialer for that matter) really is mishandling the SCO bluetooth connection for some reason or another, I can absolutely see how it will screw up the SCO BT transfer to and from CSS, regardless the brand or model of phone or BT hardware involved.</p>

<p>To save others time and a lot of misdirected grief, I would keep this in mind for future issues coming from others and refer them here if the answer to the question of "Are you using the stock dialer and is your phone fully updated?" is anything other than "Yes".</p>

<p>Thanks again Regis for a killer app and for your support,
~ Trip</p></markdown-widget>
