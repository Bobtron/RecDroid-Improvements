<p>Could you try to install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-15-16.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-15-16.apk</a> .</p>

<p>It include 3 hidden settings. To activate it :
Go in Settings &gt; press menu and switch to "Expert mode".
Then in Settings &gt; Media scroll to the bottom.
The 3 settings are :
Use Routing API =&gt; It enforce to use the old API that is deprecated in android 2.0. Some ROM however are based on old audio drivers but are &gt; to 2.0. In this case activating this setting can help
Use Mode API =&gt; It enforce to use something that is actually not an API but that is considered by some manufacturer to be the way to route audio... It's a very bad idea to use that on some device cause it use mode_in_call that directly plug GSM chipset to audio hardware. But sometimes on some devices that's the only way to get routing goes through earpiece.
In Call Mode =&gt; (Useless if you use "Mode API"), Force to use one audio mode. On most device should be set to Normal. But sometimes could be interesting to test others.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I'm using a Samsung Moment with 2.1 (DE03). The symptoms are exactly as above. Using the Mode API option, the audio is routed to the ear piece. However, while this option is enabled the microphone only works while in Speaker mode during a call.</p>

<p>The other options have no affect on this behavior. I'm going to keep fiddling with this version to see if I can get the microphone to work after all.</p>

<p>Thanks! This application just keeps getting better and better.</p>

<p>On a side note, the responsiveness while making a call in the application has greatly improved over previous versions. Thumbs up for that! :)</p>

<p>Enabling "Voice Audio Detection" resulted in the Echo service returning a zero length reply.</p>

<p>IE: The message says "Say something after the beep and press # when done."
I would say something, or make a noise for a time, maybe 20 seconds.
I would press # to indicate I was done with the recording.
Then the playback of the recorded message would come after that, followed by a "Good bye" message from the service.
However, with Voice Audio Detection enabled it would go from me pressing #, immediately to the "Good bye" message no matter how long of a message I recorded.
Probably because Voice Audio Detection wasn't sending any data.</p>

<p>Messing with the amplification settings made no difference, and as indicated in the post above mine, changing Call Mode made no different for anything. The same can be said for "Use Routing API" on my Samsung Moment with 2.1 (DE03).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok maybe my test and my developer experience on the galaxy S may help you to understand what is happening on your phone. I was able to test on a galaxy S i9000 of a colleague.
Here were my conclusions :
* If I set audio mode to IN_CALL (which is done by "use Mode API" when trying to use earpiece), on the samsung driver :
 - They route the audio output to earpiece 
 - They route micro directly to the GSM chipset (so that android application doesn't get any audio stream from micro).
As consequence choosing IN_CALL mode or Mode API is not a good idea for galaxy S (i9000).
* If I set audio mode to NORMAL, on the i9000 : 
 - They don't change the routing for output
 - They route properly micro.
 - As soon as I try to use routing APIs or new API to set speakerphone mode, it route to speakerphone and it's impossible to get the routing back to the earpiece only unless I set again mode to IN_CALL.</p>

<p>As consequence my workaround that actually works for galaxy S is to first set mode to IN_CALL and then set to NORMAL.
So on Galaxy S I get something working with Use routing api disabled, Use mode api disabled and in call Mode "NORMAL".</p>

<p>What is a little bit annoying is that on your phone that is also a Samsung it doesn't behaves the same. I think that setting back to normal re-route audio to rear-speaker.... I so my workaround will not work, and I fear that nobody using the android audio api will succeed in doing something that works on this device. If so, users should cry to Samsung and say them that's a petty to do a device that doesn't respect android API ! 
I've already done a lot of workaround to get things works on their driver. (Even in the core glue with the driver there is very strange and not useful things done is this driver, for example the audio client must ensure that it doesn't ask for frames to the driver at a rate higher than the frequency and if so, the galaxy S driver just behaves a really crappy way).</p>

<p>The first opened issue was about the fact it was not possible to route through speaker. So I guess that the first opening issue was just that it was not possible to route through rear speaker (but that it actually worked through earpiece).</p></markdown-widget>

<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#setSpeakerphoneOn%28boolean%29">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#setSpeakerphoneOn%28boolean%29</a></p>

<p>That's pretty simple :)... It actually do nothing when audio mode is set to NORMAL and when we are streaming live audio.</p>

<p>However, there is maybe a workaround for your phone I can't say. It took me time to solve the problem on Galaxy S. 
So there is still hope for all devices. 
I've read things about changing the encoding mode that could be changed. That's something that I could add as a test option.</p>

<p>I'll try to add this option maybe it could help.... but that will just be empiric tries. As the logic behavior should have been to simply have to "setSpeakerphoneOn" working...</p></markdown-widget>

I think that if samsung fix your issue, my workaround to get routing through earpiece will not work anymore ! (A good thing would be that they globally fix their audio driver !)</p>

<p>Anyway, the overall problem is that Samsung did crappy things with their audio routing implementation. You should report that to samsung not to android project. It is actually the guilt of Samsung with their audio driver implementation. Android stock application (and also CSipSimple ;) ) use the android API normally.</p></markdown-widget>
