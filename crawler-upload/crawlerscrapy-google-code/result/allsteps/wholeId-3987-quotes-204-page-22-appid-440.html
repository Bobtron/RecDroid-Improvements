                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok interesting. I should consider enabling by default disable contact rewrite for sipgate wizard.</p>

<p>Now for the explaination : 
pjsip (the sip stack on which CSipSimple rely), has a feature (enabled by default) that allow to workaround many simple NAT use case. 
NAT is something that can break SIP cause it make the device not aware of its own public IP. As consequence it does not communicate with the rest of the world with the correct IP. </p>

<p>So pjsip guys has developed a cool feature to detect from the first registration the public IP of the device based on the reply of the registration. 
However this method require two consecutive registration (one to get the public IP and one registration which is the actual registration with relevant datas).</p>

<p>There is several two ways to cancel the first registration (the legacy and the new one) -- that the purpose of the "rewrite method" field. However a sip server could decide to ignore these unregister and leave active the first registration.</p>

<p>However, there is another way to solve NAT issue. It's to use a STUN server. Many SIP client activate it by default. CSipSimple does not cause it lead to worse problems on some countries. However some wizard automatically add and configure a stun server if providen by the provider. The good point is that sipgate wizard already do that :). So in theory there is no risk to modify the sipgate wizard and disable by default contact rewrite as it works for you.</p>

<p>I hope that enlight a little bit things about what it does and why ;)</p>

<p>I rename the issue to track the change on the sigate wizard. Thanks for the report and the test </p></markdown-widget>

<p>I saw two INVITEs, one to my public IP, and one to the private IP on my phone behind NAT. They both reached the phone. So now that I know that CSipSimple registers twice, it appears that, as you said, cancelling the first registration on sipgate failed.</p>

<p>Sorry that I didn't tell you this before, but I was quite busy earlier and I still wanted to let you know that the workaround fixed the issue.</p>
