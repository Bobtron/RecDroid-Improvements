1. Receive incoming call
2. Answer It</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expected output is for audio to heard from the headset earpiece, speaker, or bluetooth ear piece.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Galaxy Nexus (GSM)
Jelly Bean 4.1.1
csipsimple r1710
SIP Provider: CallCentric</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I can place outgoing calls and everything works fine. I can hear the person I am talking to and that person can hear me. When receiving an incoming call the person I am attempting to talk to can hear me, but I can not hear them.</p>

<p>I have toggled STUN and ICE on without much success. However, it is my understanding that because I'm going through a proxy (callcentric) NAT is not an issue.</p>

<p>I have turned off bluetooth without any luck. I have rebooted the phone with bluetooth disabled, no luck. I am open to any ideas.</p>

<p>Please let me know what additional data you need from me.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Can you try to produce the logs with just STUN option enabled (not ICE)? On these logs, apparently the IP transmitted to callcentric by the application is the private one, so could be normal that you don't get any sound incoming.</p>

<p>Maybe there is something broken in STUN process but I need the logs to see how it goes ;).</p>

<p>And indeed, weird that it's just for incoming calls. Can you check the codec in use when in incoming and the one used when in outgoing? It could be some interesting clue. (To check that, press the arrow of the call card, and select option; you'll see something like PCMU or PCMA). Usually when behavior is not identical between incoming and outgoing it's something with codec negociation that could not reach same result if incoming or outgoing.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>During incoming calls I transmitting a rtp stream, but I am not receiving an rtp stream. This explains the lack of audio. I've tried to compare these two streams but haven't noticed anything substantively different. I did notice some of the sip packets differ slightly.</p>

<p>Packet dumps were done with tcpdump on the router's wan interface. It is my understanding tcpdump grabs packets before they get filtered by iptables.</p>

The interesting point - that I didn't notice previously but that was already present in first app logs you collected - is that CSipSimple seems to not recognize the call comes from the callcentric account and reply with the local account instead of the callcentric one.
However it should not be a problem since what's important for media session is SDP and seems correct. But maybe callcentric does something special and tries to treat contact sip uri.</p>

<p>I'll try to deep more in logs tomorrow in order to try to understand why pjsip doesn't recognize the incoming account. 
One question too, what is the remote side? Is it another callcentric account or a landline number?</p>

<p>One side note too : I've changed a setting in recent nightly builds that may not have been reported automatically. As you already had the problem in one of the first nightly build I don't think it will help at all, but could be good to delete and create again (in csipsimple) your callcentric account to re-apply settings.</p>

<p>I'll keep you in touch of my investigations. Thanks a lot for the very detailed logs.</p></markdown-widget>

The also ask to suppress VAD (in csipsimple it's in media settings &gt; VAD / voice auto deletion)</p>

<p>But I don't think these settings can help with the problem (except maybe the DNS SRV). I think that the root problem is the fact pjsip doesn't detect the incoming call as coming from callcentric. I'll try to find out why.</p></markdown-widget>

Actually CSipSimple and Zoiper are not talking to the same Callcentric server. While CSipSimple talks to regular callcentric entry point on port 5060, if it does a dns srv resolution it will talk to an alpha server of callcentric clusters on port 5080. So it changes more things that what I thought. However, I'm still not sure it will help a lot.</p></markdown-widget>

But after deeper analysis it sounds very weird : callcentric seems to reply with g729 codec while the app doesn't propose it.
The weird thing is that it was not present in previous version. Newer version adds new informations in the codec proposal (about the bandwidth) but normally the sip server should ignore that if not supported and instead seems they thought there is g729 in the proposal.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Just download the file on your android and install it. If you never installed from an apk file directly follow instructions here :

The related issue : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=2343">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=2343</a> (raised 31hours ago and pushed to nightly build this morning ;) ).</p>

<p>The nightly builds are evolving more rapidly than the one on the play store that aims to target <em>ALL</em> users. 
Workarounds for specific devices can wait more and we need to be sure there is no regressions in current version before marking it stable and releasing it for everybody. That's why it's not yet on the playstore version.
However, a new stable version should be released very soon as nightly builds should be stable enough those days. I've still some concern with some feedback mentioning it cuts audio for other apps (but I'm not able to reproduce the problem). </p></markdown-widget>

<p>I think this problem may be back!</p>

<p>I am on 1.02.03-2459 installed from the F-Droid repo.  I can make outgoing calls via CallCentric just fine.  However, incoming calls from CallCentric have no audio in either direction.</p>

<p>On investigating, CSipSimple is sending the RTP on a random port 50000:65535 and this is being blocked by my firewall.  If I open the firewall to allow this large port range, all then works OK. Thing is, CSipSimple is configured in global network settings to use RTP port 4000 onwards and CallCentric in expert profile has RTP port set to -1.  My firewall has a rule to allow 4000:4007 - this rule has been OK for use with CallCentric for several years.  It appears CSipSimple is again ignoring this configuration and using a random port...?</p>

<p>The codec being selected for incoming calls is PCMU.</p></markdown-widget>
