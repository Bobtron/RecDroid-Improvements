1. Updating to latest version of CCS and android. 
2. Use G729 as preferred codec for both slow and fast connection. 
3. Place call over Wifi, works fine. 4. Switch to mobile data and place the call - 408 / Request timeout. </p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>The previous versions worked flawlessly over all types of network. It isn't doing so since latest update. Switching between networks should not prevent outgoing calls. </p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>It sounds like the problem is with the size of the sip packet.</p>

<p>There is some technical point to know to understand what you are experimenting.
On some network the size of the message sent (over UDP) are limited by the network routers of the carrier. This limit cannot be anticipated and depends of the carrier. When a packet is too big the network do not transmit it and do not inform the application that it was not transmitted. So the application think it was sent and is waiting for a reply from the server to acknowledge the call is taken into account. If the invite message was not transmitted we will never receive that and timeout.</p>

<p>So... the reason is probably that you reached the limit of the size of your network for the invite message. The biggest part of the invite message is to announce all codecs by the app. So if you upgraded and have for example the codec pack + the default codecs + enabled some other codecs you can reach this limit very quickly.
A simple solution consists in disabling all codecs you know that will never be negotiated in a call. (Most of the time only 1 or 2 codecs are actually needed, but these codecs depends on your sip provider, so I can't setup that by default).
-&gt; disable codecs you don't need in Settings &gt; media &gt; codecs. (especially the mpeg4-generic that is long to announce as it contains some parameters info)</p>

<p>Another setting that can help (if supported by your sip provider) is the sip compact mode that also significantly reduce the sip messages size. -&gt; enable "sip compact mode" in settings &gt; network. (I can't enable this one by default because some sip provider are not compliant with this part of the sip standard)</p>

<p>I hope it helps you to understand the technical reason behind that and that the settings I mentioned helped you to configure the app for your case.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Thank you for the detailed solution - was really helpful to have a better understanding of the issue! App worked perfectly as I set G729 as the only codec for both network speeds, as well as SIP compact mode ON.</p>

<p>You're welcome. One of the goal of the app (as it's an opensource GPL app) is also to explain problems. That's why I try to give detailed reasons (sometimes too technical). 
Knowledge is important for freedom. As purpose of a GPL app is to give as many freedom as possible to users : use the app, study the source code, modify the source code and redistribute it (modified or not) to anyone. 
I try to transmit as many knowledge as I can so that users can also configure and get rid of problems even when using other apps. As I have no commercial benefit with csipsimple if users are more pleased with other apps it's not a problem for me if they switch. If I can globally improve the user experience and push other apps to implement more features and give more freedom to users communications I'll be pleased :).</p>

<p>BTW, with this spirit in mind, just my 2 cents about the g729 codec : as you understood it's a patented codec. Users should push to stop the usage of these patented codecs. IMHO, its bad for freedom of communication as it makes mandatory for each participant of a call to pay for using it. I understand that it can be made mandatory by your sip provider but users should complain to these providers and ask them to support more codecs. There is very good technical alternatives. For example silk codec that was opensourced by Skype uses low bandwidth (less than g729) and has great quality (and is optimized for mobile). There is also other alternatives such as iLBC codec etc.</p></markdown-widget>
