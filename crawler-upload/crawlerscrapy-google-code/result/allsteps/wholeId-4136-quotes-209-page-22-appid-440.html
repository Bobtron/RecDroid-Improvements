Also forgot to mention before, my connections for fixed adsl &amp; WBB both use static IP addresses from my provider. The adsl is nat'd but the wirelessBB is not. Using STUN, ICE or both makes no difference. my provider also supplies the SIP service we are using and have no port blocking for voIp as they are actively encouraging us to use their voip service &amp; in fact have written their own app for use on iphones.
Also while i think of it, your CSipsimple application is by far the best mobile Sip client I have tried to date. If this little nag could be fixed it would wonderful.</p></markdown-widget>

So servers does not support very well codec renegociation and it may lead to receive audio in a codec not expected by the application.
To check if this is the problem, a good test is to disable all codecs but PCMU and see how it goes. 
Then, you should select the best codec supported by your sip provider as the only available codec in csipsimple.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I don't think this is an codec negociatio problem. I think it relates instead to the incorrect routing of audio set by the ROM on my phone.

Somebody on the sipdroid mentioned a working work around in csipsimple. I'll search in history what were working settings to share.
Normally when there is working workaround I add auto detection for the device so that any body benefit of that.
Can you send me logs from your device (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page) so that I can see the device model.
Also after switching to use mode API,try to reboot the phone.If it's a rom bug they don't take into account reset made by apps.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>This is a seperate issue from Sipdroid.</p>

<p>With Sipdroid, Audio is routed inccorectly through rear speaker, with CSip, no audio is heard at all.</p>

<p>This is what I tried after what you said. Convinced I had tried all these options before, including the Samsung Galaxy S hack, i thought I best give it a go again, but this time log my doings:</p>

<p>1-
Use Mode API = true
Use Routing API = true
Audio mode while in call = MODE_IN_CALL
Reboot
Test Call
Result= No Incoming Audio through Earpiece</p>

<p>2- 
Use Mode API = true
Use Routing API = FALSE
Audio mode while in call = MODE_IN_CALL
Reboot
Test Call
Result= No Incoming Audio through Earpiece</p>

<p>3-
Use Mode API = true
Use Routing API = true
Samsung Galaxy Hack = true
Audio mode while in call = MODE_IN_CALL
Reboot
Test call
Result= No Incoming Audio through Earpiece</p>

<p>4-
Mode API = true
Use Routing API = true
Audio mode while in call = MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION (Default)
Reboot
Test Call
Result= No Incoming Audio through Earpiece</p>

<p>5- (Default Set Up)
Use Mode API = FALSE
Use Routing API = FALSE
Audio mode while in call = MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION (Default)
Reboot
Test Call
Result= No Incoming Audio through Earpiece</p>

<p>I tried mode in call = Normal and RINGTONE too. No change.</p>

<p>I sent the log, but here it is also.</p>

The more strange things is that when doing an audio test you get things working properly. That's why I thought that was something with media negotiation (
topology or codec).</p>

<p>What could be interesting, is that when in call, you press the menu key.
And select "Media" option.</p>

<p>Here there is some jauge indicating level received from your mic and from other side. If there is no activity on remote side, it's definitely something with network/audio negotiation. If there is activity it's something with android audio layer only.</p>

<p>You could also, when in call press the little arrow under the contact photo and select "Info", you'll see packet loss statistic and remote peer. It could be interesting to see if a peer is detected or not.</p>

<p>Also, I've fixed something in recent nightlies that could have side effects on this kind of situation (I'm not sure it's not regression free, but worth to test). This fix could explain why it works only once and then is broken.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>All tests were made on default settings apart from Mode=In Call</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Call 1 - Suceeded, Audio through earpiece.
Call 2 - Unsucceeded, No Audio through earpiece.
Call 3 - Suceeded, Audio through earpiece.</p>

<p>Rest of my calls no longer work. Strange</p>

<p>Well, i checked in the info and each time it shows an IP address/sip address that it is connected too, sometimes the call id is unknown, sometimes it comes up with the caller id name. There is no packet loss at all each time I have checked. There is a figure though, one small figure usually 150~ms, the other ranges from 5000-8000~ ms. Is this the delay? is this causing the problem?</p>

<p>Bandwidth is shown as 64kbps/74kbps</p>

<p>On top of this, sometimes the call doesn't reach csip at all, e.g it doesn't ring. This continues until i re register the client.</p>

<p>Still doesn't make any sense that firing works flawlessly and this doesn't!</p>

Talkatone routes audio via the external speaker like sipdroid does. In talkatone you can only chose between system, music and VOICE CALL as options.</p>

<p>I also tried Counterpath Bria. This works fine through the earpiece with "Voice Call" selected as the playback stream.</p>

<p>In Bria all settings are default apart from the connection strategy as (server side NAT). With Stun, Stun3g, Ice, Ice3g all disabled and only DNS SRV enabled.</p>

<p>Now I am wondering if the problem with Csip is indeed the connection to the server, but more-so how csip lets built in server NAT work of my providor (IPtel).</p>

<p>Would be interesting to learn how these applications work differently, but it does seem like the problem with csip is not a routing one, but instead a connection related one. Even since the settings seem to be the same.</p>

<p>To rule out a problem with codec negotion, I have disabled all codecs but GSM in my tests, since I know that works fine.</p></markdown-widget>
