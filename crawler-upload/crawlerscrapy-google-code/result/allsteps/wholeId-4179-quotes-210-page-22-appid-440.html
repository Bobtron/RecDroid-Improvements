1. Setup gizmo5 account in csipsimple
2. Gizmo5 number is one of my forwarding numbers in GV
3. Initiate a call from gv webpage or with gv call back free</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
I expect my phone to ring, and after I answer I should hear the ringing on the other side.
Instead, when I answer, I don't hear a thing. No sound. A couple of times, I heard one or two seconds of ringing and that was it. No sound after that. In coming calls are the same. The caller cannot hear me &amp; I cannot hear him/her.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Nightly build on 01/20/2011. I'm using android 2.2.1 (CM6.1) on Nexus One</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>I have nexus one running cyanogenmod 6.1 (android 2.2 froyo).
The phone has no sim card. I'm on my home wifi.
Nightly build of csipsimple installed. I enter my gizmo5 account and registers ok. I initiate a google voice call from the gv webpage and/or gv call back free. It rings my gizmo5 number (my phone). When I pick up, it should start ringing the party I'm trying to reach. Instead, I hear nothing.</p>

<p>Note: It worked for about 20 hours when I set it up. Then suddenly, this is what is happening. When someone calls me, i can't hear them; they can't hear me. When I initiate a call &amp; answer it, I don't hear anything afterwards. Please help. Thanks for this wonderful application.</p></markdown-widget>

Some applications such as sipdroid or 3cx and probably others use the same networks ports than me so that our application just conflicts and can lead to this kind of problem. Regarding your description that's the more probable.</p>

<p>Another idea I have is about settings. Maybe worth to try to reset settings. As you are using nightly build you can do that directly in csipsimple settings, press menu and reset default settings.</p>

<p>You could also try to reboot the phone. Maybe another app is holding the audio API and prevent other apps to use it with stream voice call type.</p></markdown-widget>

1. I don't have any other SIP application installed.
2. Since the nightly build I use gives a configuration for Gizmo5, I don't touch the settings at all.
3. I have wiped my sd card, flashed the rom all over again, and installed the nightly but the problem still exists.</p>

<p>I got a little adventurous and gave the latest nightly build of CM7 (android 2.3) a try. So first, I tried the built in sip client. I thought since google owns gizmo5 and they built it (the client) into android 2.3, it would work. I was wrong. I set it up just like we see in one of those youtube videos with my gizmo account; the problem still exist. Then I deleted the sip account in android 2.3 and installed your nightly build to give it a chance again in the new 2.3 platform, and it was as before.</p>

<p>Since the problem existed even with the built sip client in 2.3, I beginning to think that it is not a problem with csipsimple. But I just don't know/understand what it is. I thought maybe gizmo5 is down; but when I go to gizmocall.com and enter my info, it works. I hear audio and the other party can hear me. At this point I'm clueless. Nothing has changed about my wireless at home. It is the same one I was on when it worked for those first 20 or so hours.</p>

<p>So as you can see, I've really tried to isolate and figure out what or where this is coming from but......... no joy yet.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Yes I understand.
Well there were another bug report with CM7. I'm not absolutely sure that the ROM is stable yet.</p>

<p>There is something I'm quietly sure about it is that CM probably does not yet handle properly the new SIP wifi lock that should prevent the PSP mode. For this we have to wait an official release from google with a correct wifi driver. (That's the reason why I didn't update my nexus one yet).
Regarding the code of the new 2.3 sip client it requires some things to be properly managed in the audio stack. It is possible that Cyanogen works hard on this point currently. So probably linked to that.</p>

<p>On my side I'll wait for the official 2.3 upgrade on my N1 to validate that CSipSimple works properly on 2.3. Cause it's too risky to do work for the 2.3 of CM while Cyanogen has not yet everything to provide a good support of 2.3 drivers.</p>

<p>I think that also the stock SIP apps from google will be better with official ROM.</p>

<p>This stuff is really tricky. Do not blame Cyanogen for that he do a great job, but Google does not really help us (ROM maker and SIP application makers). For example there is some hidden API that google does not communicate on available on 2.3 to enable a true SIP support. Fortunately android source code is open and we can read the source code and deduce things from it ;).</p>

<p>But as for this issue, for now I'll say that I'll not fix it until I can really test an official 2.3. Hope you understand.</p>

<p>As soon as my N1 will be upgraded to the official 2.3 I ensure that I'll do everything I can to have a true support of 2.3 (and also I'll probably give a way to manage stock SIP application).</p></markdown-widget>

I really do appreciate you guys and the whole android community for this support. My nexus never feels left behind.</p>

<p>That said, I'm going to go back to CM6.1.1. Can you tell me what configuration you have on ur nexus that makes csipsimple work with gizmo5 (if u have a gizmo5 account). I chose not to renew my t-mobile contract to save money for a while. So I'm (thinking of) going the voip route until things get better 4 me financially.</p>

<p>Also, I set up an ekiga account and tried it. That one works. I get audio both ways. smh</p></markdown-widget>

After some extensive research, I read that not all routers play nice with sip/voip. I changed the router to my old netgear one and it worked. It has worked on any other wifi since. So my router was the culprit here. Thanks for giving attention to this issue; and thanks for developing this wonderful application for us.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>(Just for reference for other users that may also be affected by the same issue ;) )</p>

<p>Also interesting point could be whether you activated firewall on the router. I know that some router firewall in order to block DoS attack block SIP (which is weird but done by some router/firewall ;) )</p></markdown-widget>
