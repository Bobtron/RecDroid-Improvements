Uninstall the version from the market before installing this one. (I should really quickly push on the market the latest one... but there so much thing to do :) ). If you need help to install the dev version, just ask me.</p>

<p>Just an additional question. Samsung Vibrant is another name for Galaxy S and i9000, isn't it? Just for my information (since other users with galaxy S/i9000 are experimenting issue with micro), can you say me what is the firmware version (In android Settings &gt; About phone &gt; Firmware (should be something like XXJM2 or XXJF3).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Seems that there is something samsung did strangely with speakerphone/earpiece routing.
If you disable ringer (set phone to vibrate for example) it will goes through earpieace.
But... if you activate speakerphone, you'll never be able to switch back to earpiece (which is coherent with the fact when the phone rings, then sound goes through speaker).</p>

<p>That's really a strange behavior, and I decided to wait for the samsung update to 2.2 (that is announce for the next weeks) since it seems to be something samsung do not correctly. There is probably a workaround for current rom (as fring has a solution... they don't share ;) ), but I guess it's a workaround.
If with 2.2 we reproduce the issue, I'll spend time on this issue to solve it.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>It means that I can already have a closer look to find out how to solve this problem. 
Can you confirm that Fring with incoming call  - and a ringing state before - redirect output to earpiece?
If so, can be a good starting point for me to do reverse engineering on what is done by Fring ... maybe they add a delay before call establishment or use another audio mode.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Fring:
- I can confirm there is a ring state and a slight lag before I hear audio though the ear piece.
- After that slight lag the call seems to work fine however audio can be rather laggy / choppy.</p>

<p>Nimbuzz:
- App manages to redirect audio to the ear piece but shortly after the call disconnects.
- There is a very noticeable lag-time from when I answer the call to when I hear the conversation through the earpieces.</p>

<p>3CX:
- Calls work fine, noticeable delay between when I answer to when I hear audio through the ear piece.</p>

<p>Additional information:
- For all three applications I have used the sip provider Voxalot.
- 3CX seems to have the best and most reliable sip calls out of the three applications.
- All apps seem to experience lag time when audio is redirected to the ear piece.</p>

<p>Anyway hope that helps, and if you need me to test anything else just ask : )

I am having a similar issue with a T-mobile pulse (Huawei U8220) on the latest dev builds. Looking at the output on logcat I noticed I was getting this messasge:</p>

<p>W/AudioFlinger( 1067): RecordThread: buffer overflow </p>

<p>This led me the the following thread:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=146">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=146</a></p>

<p>So I tried the version you recommended in there:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-18.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-18.apk</a> </p>

<p>And voila, I was getting sound through the ear-set speaker. Is there a later version I could try that still uses the same method of audio routing?</p>

<p>Thanks very much for such a great app.</p></markdown-widget>

As for your issue, it was reported in private by somebody else. I would need your android version. Is that android 1.6? I guess that I introduced a regression recently while refactoring to make it work another device.
What could help me a lot if you have some time to spend is testing from 12-18 until the sound goes through the speaker and say me the last version that works OK for you.
Since in fact for this kind of issue, logs are not really helpful since it depends only on the interpretation of the phone of android functions (which are more or less deprecated or useful according to the device/android version).</p></markdown-widget>

The last version of the currently hosted releases which worked with the pulse was:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-19.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-19.apk</a> </p>

<p>The next release after this, namely:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-22.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-22.apk</a> ,</p>

<p>reverted back the playing the calls through the rear speaker. I believe the intermediary releases 12-20 and 12-21 have been removed from the download section so I could not try these.</p></markdown-widget>

Could you try 0.00-13-02 (that has been validated to solve this issue). I guess you tried 0.00-13-06b. I hope that I didn't introduce a regression in this one. Let me know.
Another thing : you should uninstall sipdroid and other sip app to be sure there is nothing that change routing when testing the app</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Incoming seems to work correctly and the volume of the incoming call is 'normal'.  The outgoing calls still seem to be routing through my rear speaker.  However, if I turn the speaker phone on (bottom right button I think, and then turn it off) it seems to route correctly.</p>

<p>Not sure if the same work around would work in the latest beta.  I will try that in a min.</p>

<p>(2 mins later)</p>

<p>So I tried the same thing with the latest beta 0.00-13.06b and indeed am hitting the same problem.  Perhaps my issue is a different problem to this?  If the fix was only for incoming calls maybe this is a problem I am seeing with outgoing?</p>

<p>My phone is run JH2 firmware on the Bell Samsung Galaxy S (I9000M) this is the canada branding, but I have been told on XDA that this is the same as the I9000.  I am also running 2.1 Eclair update 1. </p></markdown-widget>

When you dial for outgoing, are you using csipsimple dialer? And if yes, when you press a dialpad key is there a sound? 
If I well remember, I did my tests without sound feedback from dialpad and as it produce sound it could conflict the outgoing sound stream then.
Also, if you can try to reboot the phone just before testing. If another app has set the audio routing in a bad state, CSipSimple can be impacted.
I'll try to ask my colleague to borrow me his phone today to see if I can reproduce your problem (I'll also try to solve the volume issue).
Anyway, could you send me logs? (See HowToCollectLogs on the wiki - there is a particular manipulation).</p>

<p>Last point I'm really interested in (not directly linked to your issue), with I9000M and 0.00-13-06b installed (with all previous version uninstalled before); if you go in settings &gt; media , are speaker amplification and micro amplification set to 0.2 and 0.4? (These default values should be populated by 0.00-13-06b automatically if freshly installed to avoid echo problems).</p></markdown-widget>

So if you can test the latest version and say me if there is no regression for your device, would be nice :). I did changes that stay in the same idea but changed the flow and how delays of the micro are managed.</p>

I would like to tell you my experience with my HTC MAGIC v. 1.6 and your csipsimple 0.00-15-03:
- Rear speaker is now off when I start a call, I can make a regular call using the standard handset.
- the buttons of the volume in the side of the phone move "multimedia app volume", but I can't hear any difference in my ear. The level that really influence the level is "Call volume".
- when I start a call, I can see a disabled speaker on the notify area; if I click on the speaker icon in the bottom right , I can see the icon on the notify area disappearing and then reappearing immediatly, but speaker is always off.
- after touching the icon button, I can see many audio channels (notify volume, system volume etc) to level 0 till I close my call.</p>

<p>I used "Audiomanager" to see these changes.</p>

<p>hope this could help</p>

<p>thanks again
Guido</p>

Everything work as expected in my magic 1.6 official vodafone!

I close (NextRelease) the issue since 1.6 regression was the latest thing to do regarding this problem.</p>

<p>For Galaxy S owners, there is the issue 254 for specific audio volume change.</p>

<p>I think that I'll do a soft volume change instead of delegating it to the android sound system (which is really inconsistent...)</p></markdown-widget>

I got a Samsung Galaxy S and upgraded it to FroYo.DXJPE. Downloaded the latest CSipSimple-0.01.apk using Market but it's also automatically going to Speaker. Can't seem to turn speaker off when making outgoing calls. I've not tried incoming calls yet. </p>
