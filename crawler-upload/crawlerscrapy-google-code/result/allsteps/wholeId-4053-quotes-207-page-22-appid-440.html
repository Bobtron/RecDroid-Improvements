1. On start the Library doesn't get downloaded.
2. On account creation, App crashes because of SipService failure to load the Library
3. Old revisions in svn, result in infinite downloading of the lib.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Either Library download on start or just single time library download for previous revisions.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
I am using Eclipse IDE on windows, have tested it on Emulator2.2 and Htc Hero 2.1</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I have Checked out the recent version from SVN repository, which ends up NOT downloading the Library on the first run, and app crashes on the Sip account creation.
If i check out the Revision#500 or other old revisions, then the app ends up on downloading the Library infinitely on every launch.</p>

<p>I will really appreciate if you can kindly help me out in resolving this issue.</p></markdown-widget>

If you'd like to join the google group just ask it here :

In fact now, that's required, the old way is obsolete it was too unstable. Now you must have a valid navite lib in the good folder. (However if you don't want to bother with building native lib you can get it from a nightly build extracting content of apk and putting libpjsipjni.so files in the right place).</p></markdown-widget>

tell me about the appropriate Libs that i should download to cover the
Android1.6-2.3, or is it the architecture of the mobile phones against which
the libraries are being built.
One last thing , can i build and test it on the emulator ? adn are there any

<p>As for android 1.5 to 2.3 ... everything in CSipSimple is already compatible. Do not confuse between the target SDK and the actually compatible SDK version. CSipSimple is compatible from android 1.5 even if target sdk is 2.2.
(There is only the gingerbread edition available in nightly builds that is only compatible with android 2.3, all others are fine with 1.5 and upper).</p>

<p>On emulator as I've just added on the wiki, you'll experiment a very bad audio quality. I do not advise to use it using emulator. With Qemu audio quality will be awful and besides it will pledge the CPU. So do not test audio.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As for library produced, when you'll read the ndk documentation you'll know more about the android arch. </p>

<p>You'll see that for now there is armeabi and armeabi-v7a. That armeabi is compatible with armeabi-v7a device but that it's better to have an optimized version for v7a device (specially for floating point support).
The NDK re-distributed in CSipSimple also allow to build for amrv4t. The android ndk also ~should~ allow to build for x86. But never tried it... for now I've no device running this arch. Maybe I should try with the vm x86 port of android....
But anyway, nobody asked for that arch for now... I'll have a closer look if anybody ask.</p></markdown-widget>

enjoying the features of the sip stack... Actually what i want to do is
prompt user 2 login to its sip account by entering Sip Username, password
and server address, and register the sip profile with the given credentials,
after that i want user to start using the app without getting bothered about
the accounts and all. Any tips ?? i do realise that i have to first remove
any existing SIP accounts and then create a Sip account with the given
credentials and register it. once registered i will show the dialer.</p>

<p>and regarding the android ported ffmpeg, i will really appreciate if you can
give me some pointers.</p></markdown-widget>
