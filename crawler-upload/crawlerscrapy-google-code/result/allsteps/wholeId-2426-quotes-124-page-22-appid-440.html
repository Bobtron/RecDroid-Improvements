The relevant information to debug this is the device model and if it's stock ROM or a custom android ROM.</p>

<p>What you can try to get things working is to follow the steps indicated in the section :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ?wl=en#Audio_routing_troubleshooting">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ?wl=en#Audio_routing_troubleshooting</a></p>

<p>In your case, I think that modifying the "Audio Mode for SIP calls" could be the first thing to try. And if it doesn't help you can also try the "Audio implementation" (and switch to java-jni instead of opensl-es).
It could also be interesting to try to press the "speaker" button while in call (as it changes the audio routing too). Any observation you may do by tweaking these settings can be interesting to help to find the correct settings. Manufacturer doesn't interprete the android audio api the same way -even sometimes they change the way it behaves from one device to another - and I might recognize a common pattern from observation you will do tweaking these settings.</p>

<p>If you get some settings working I'm very very interested in what are the working settings and what is the device and the ROM.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Mmmmh, ok.
So I think "Use mode api" and "Audio mode for SIP calls" should help to get this fixed.
The Galaxy S 1 has a very very special behavior. There is a special dedicated hack for it (the Galaxy S hack that you'll find in settings and should normally be already automatically activated as the app detected the device as a SGS1).
I hope that guys from cyanogen didn't broke the hack that was the only solution to get things working and routed properly to earpiece on this device. </p>

<p>To quickly sum-up the problem if you are interested in the technical part : SGS1 audio driver when comes to "in_call" mode plug directly the the micro to the GSM chipset and apps on the OS are not able to treat what comes from micro in this case. That's why we should use the "normal mode". But... problem on SGS1... if we use sgs mode without doing something special before, the output audio is routed to rear speaker ! I can imagine the headaches it gave me to understand that. Fortunately while testing I found that a hack was possible : if we first ask mode "in_call" and then ask mode "normal" the audio will be routed on earpiece and micro will be working :). This hack I shared with other sip applications and is AFAIK the only way sip apps can works on this device with the stock ROM from samsung. With custom rom it's not true because they usually fixes this problem cleanly.</p>

<p>Also, another info : I had some problems with the CM mod recently and they had a lot of bugs with audio routing and opensl-es implementation (on other devices than the SGS1). 
Not to blame them, they do excellent job, but the audio driver of the SGS1 is a pain and they probably get hard time to make it stable and reliable for third party applications.
So, as you are using a very recent CM mod, I advise you to switch to the legacy "java implementation" (in audio implementation). 
It has a little bit worse performance, but I fear it's less stable on CM recently, so better to not take the risk to introduce another possible cause of problems in first tests.</p></markdown-widget>
