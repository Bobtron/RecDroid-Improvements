1. Configure the CSipSimple to use TCP
2. Register CSipSimple with an Asterisk-based PBX server
3. Call someone and then try to hang up on the CSipSimple client (regardless whether or not they answer).</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
- The expected output is that the call hangs up cleanly.
Instead:
- The red hangup button visibly responds to touch but nothing happens.
- The issue is intermittent but regular.
- The call never times out.
- CSipSimple has to be "force stop" in the App Manager. </p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what device / operating</b>
<b>system?</b>
- CSipSimple version 1.02.00
- Registering to Asterisk 11.5.1 (dont know if the version is necessarily important)</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
- TCP is important because I need to receive calls and get good battery life.
- TCP is also important because I am migrating my mobile SIP phones to use TLS.
- I understand that CSipSimple is standards based, but if you think the issue is with Asterisk I need help with some clear guidance please to raise the issue with them. :) Or any guidance on TCP settings also welcome.
- I havent experienced the issue yet when receiving calls.  So far only when initiating the call.</p></markdown-widget>

If so, it's probably just because there is a timeout.
A common mistake in asterisk configuration is to have the extension configured differently than global transport.
It results in asking the sip client to route the subsequent requests somewhere else. The client (if respect the RFC), will route subsequent requests at the new destination; but if it's wrong, it will keep retrying. This will result in timeout after long time.
CSipSimple user interface does not quit until the dialog is finished strictly regarding SIP protocol. It means that in such case it will stay long time. You can still press home button, but you'll notice that the call is not yet finished until it's actually finished. I think it's better because you notice that there were a problem and that the server considered the call duration as long as the timeout is.
It will also allow to notice server configuration problems.</p>

<p>Else, I guarantee that I already tested with properly configured asterisk on TCP and TLS and that csipsimple works with hangup. So it's not something untested and the problem you have is one that was noticed by a lot of other people with wrong config.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>If instead of setting the extension transport I follow the above and set:
    [general]
    transport=udp,tcp
Then I see the same issue.  No change.</p>

<p>If instead I set:
    [general]
    transport=tcp,udp
Voila.  It hangs up cleanly.  Perfect.</p>

<p>So why does the second example work and the first not?</p>

<p>Except, the issue I now have is that this then makes all my outbound trunks TCP by default.  And they need to remain UDP.  So I am going to need to put in the reverse:
   [trunknamegoeshere]
   transport=udp</p>

<p>Am I not going to get now the same problem on the trunks?  Or are they going to behave themselves this way around? (Dont want to get charged for not hanging up!)</p>

<p>Have I understood your advise correctly and am I implementing the solution correctly?</p>

<p>Thanks again for your advise.</p>

<p>PS. If the above is the correct solution then I really recommend getting an example on a wiki somewhere.  Happy to help to do that.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi,
Disclaimer : I'm not expert at asterisk config.</p>

<p>But from what I know, there is a configuration per extension (by extension I mean device number or user account if you prefer).
And from what I understood, it is very important is that the configuration in your extension is in coherent with how you use your extension (it's not necessarily your trunks, but your extension that you use in csipsimple).
For example, I know that <em>a lot</em> of people does a mistake configuring asterisk on a different port and forgetting to update the extension ports. AFAIK, it's goes the same for transport type (udp/tcp/tls).</p>

<p>So I guess (but I'm not sure), that what solve your problem when you change transport in general setting is that you also change it for your extension (because not specified in the extension). If you do so, you'll not need to change your trunk config, but only the config of the extension you use.
Don't ask me why asterisk is not able to automatically detect the current way the sip client connects and pick the right transport/port at registration time. AFAIK, it's works a simplier way with freeswitch for example (you only declare generally ways to connect the server and it will keep coherent replies to client when accessed by one of these ways).
Maybe there is a good reason why asterisk does that, but I'll not be able to reply (that's not an issue in scope of csipsimple ;) )</p></markdown-widget>
