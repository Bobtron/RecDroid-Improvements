<p>Maybe something with DNS synchronization...
If you can collect logs (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page).</p>

<p>You can downgrade using the download section of this website try a 0.00-15-xx (you have to choose "All downloads" in the drop down to be able to see all entries.
However, I'd prefer to solve the problem on the current version, so if you can send me logs with the latest version it could help me to fix the issue so that you could use the newer version ;)</p>

<p>Then it tries on 3G network, CSipSimple correctly send requests. However it get no response from the server. So response is 408 timeout - I think that's different from the initial issue with bad gateway.</p>

<p>In this case most of the time (here in france it is the case) it's cause 3G provider block SIP traffic. Are you sure that your 3G carrier allow VoIP SIP on their network? (I mean SIP protocol not a proprietary VoIP protocol such as Skype).</p>

<p>However, there is other case where it can occurs. I get an interesting log at the beggining of your logs about STUN : it seems that it's a double NATed environment which is really complicated to solve for SIP calls.
It was working previously with 0.00-15 on 3g network for you too?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Unfortunately no work around are possible in this case. All the more so as most of the time they specify that in their contract so that legally you are not allowed to used it. However I think that's a shame cause we espect carrier to adopt net neutrality... but well it's a matter of pressure made by users on carrier. </p>

<p>The biggest shame thing is that SIP protocol which is standard is not allowed while skype which is a close protocol is not blocked... And another really annoying thing is that SIP could be use for SIP SIMPLE protocol (that allow chat) which is allowed by the contract you get with your carrier....
So for that point we could attack the carrier cause they don't respect the contract by blocking us the availability to use our data connection to chat !!!!</p></markdown-widget>

I've something to check with the manner I upgrade the app. I've a lot of bad feedback regarding upgrade.

I've started to work on this point to improve things for next release. </p></markdown-widget>
