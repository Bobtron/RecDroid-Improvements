Was fixed with the issue 30 .
To be complete, you can already use the expert account to fix your issue (with 0.00-12).
Just change your account into an expert account.
And change account id to "DisplayName " (the account id you mentioned is not a valid account id in SIP)</p>

<p>With this configuration the other phone will see "DisplayName" as callerId. 
Issue 30 add a new wizard that simplifies the way to enter the CallerID.
At any time you can switch the account wizard for an account by pressing menu &gt; Choose wizard on the edit account view.</p></markdown-widget>

Strange. 
I assume your sip provider doesn't rewrite your contact id since it works with other sip clients...
Is that possible for you to test with the 0.00-12-07 available here, on googlecode and sending me logs using logcat?
It can help me to know what is sent in the SIP From header.</p></markdown-widget>

Can you :
* Uninstall the version installed from the market

* Install it (if you have never installed an application from an apk, you may enable unsinged app from settings &gt; application &gt; developement) (or if you have the sdk installed on your pc adb install path_to_the_apk.apk)</p>

<p>Then re-run a call and send me your logs :)
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>(Just to be more precise about why I need your log : I don't reproduce on my accounts and callerID is well displayed on remote phone. There is probably something special I don't well manage in some configuration)</p>

<p>P.S. : you can directly send me your logs by mail, better for the privacy of your infos (even if logs doesn't show passwords, they show your account uri).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I had the same issue with Rynga using csipsimple. I am now using pbxes.org as intermediate "layer". This didn't solve the issue initially but when I changed the trunk settings to the following:</p>

<p>username: 0041xxxxxxxxx (my phone number verified with Rynga Desktop client)
password: password:username (Rynga username and password both in password field!)</p>

<p>...it worked! I didn't try it without pbxes.org as I use their dial plans as well.</p>

<p>Maybe that helps, this is probably the same issue with all Betamax providers.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>It may be a fix for the Betamax and clones which I just discovered today - sorry if it's not pertaining directly to CSipSimple.</p>

<p>I had two different problems - the caller ID was not displayed at all AND when I managed to get it displayed, it had two country prefixes (+420 for Czech Republic, my country of residence, and +40 for Romania, which was part of the initial Caller ID).</p>

<p>Do as in comment #10 and specify the Caller ID in the "username" field on PBXes.org; then put the "password:username" thing in the password field.
Then go to the VoIP site (12voip, rynga etc - I'm using 12voip), check your profile and make sure the proper country (matching the Caller ID) is set up.
Then start the PC dialer that the provider offered (the software you install on the PC) and <em>validate</em> your VoIP number as a valid caller ID following their instructions - on 12voip, this means going to File - Your Personal Profile.. - bottom left corner; then you'll be called on the number you specify and be given a 4-digit PIN for validation).
Finally check the country listed in your profile <em>in the dialer</em> is also correct, i.e. it matches <em>both</em> the country listed in your web profile <em>and</em> the country where your caller ID is originating from. </p>

<p>You can also check in the "Call Monitor" section on PBXes.org if your Caller ID gets sent properly from the trunk or not. If it does, yet you don't see the right value, chances are you may have one or more of the above issues (wrong country in either place, unconfirmed number, invalid username/password setup).</p>

<p>Once you have checked all the above, make a test call. I didn't need to make any specific setting in the CSipSimple apart from username and password in the PBXes wizard and it is working fine. Just to be on the safe side, I've put the same Caller ID in the trunk and in the extension on PBXes.org.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Features :
 * Automatically remove ICE cause betamax servers does not support it
 * Balance inquery (tested on 12voip, let me know how it goes with others betamax like providers).
 * Add the stun server of the betamax clone.
 * Allow to set caller ID (as betamax clones does not use the standard way to do that, it has to be done in the wizard ! ). (p.s. I didn't try with a + sign inside but I'd advise you to not use + sign in caller id).</p>

<p>If you don't find your betamax clone let me know (I need name, sip registrar and stun if available)</p>
