1.Using a Dual Sim card phone
2.CSipSimple integrated with native dialer 
3.Place a call in native dialer, and choose what simcard to use</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
When CsipSimple is set not to handle the call,return to native dialer
whithout dropping the initial request of what simcard to use.
Now CSipSimple first takes the call,returning null to native
dialer. Maby for adding the number to the call log ? and then returning the call back to android dialer.As a result you can't choose what simcard to use.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
0.03-00,Android 2.2</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
Could you add an escape feature in OutgoingCall.java for any reason the user must escape the handling by CSipSimple like this.
if(PhoneNumberUtils.isEmergencyNumber(number)) {
    Log.d(THIS_FILE, "It's an emergency number ignore that");
            ignoreNext = "";
            setResultData(number);
            return;}
//Escape feature 
if (number.endsWith("+")) {
    number = number.substring(0,number.length()-1);
            setResultData(number);
            return;}
//Or a visible setting based on prefix all cell phone numbers in
//Sweden starts with (07) with exception of 0771.
if((number.substring(0,2).equals("07"))  &amp;&amp; !number.substring(0,3).equals("077") ){
            setResultData(number);
            return;}

Unfortunately I've no device with dual sim to test on, and android source code seems to not have this case managed. So I'm a little bit blind on this problem.
Could one of you try to collect logs (see HowToCollectLogs) (record and then try to reproduce the issue, and then stop and send logs).
Maybe I'll see some interesting clue in logs from android OS.
Or if you are able to debug one version of the project, I'd be interested in the state of of the intent when outgoingcall.java is fired (specially in its extras).</p>

<p>I could also try a different approach. There is another way I could use to list the "gsm" choice and that could maybe allow to list the other operator (Maybe it could also allow to list other third party apps such as skype).</p></markdown-widget>

It does not seems to be transmitted through the intent actually. Without the source code of the dual sim card management it's hard to understand where things goes wrong.</p>

<p>I also see that there is sipdroid on the middle before I get fired. Maybe could be interesting to temporarily remove it : just to be sure they do not remove intent extras (as I do... normally it's harmless, but if they remove it, it will not appear in my logs).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The problem seems to be because I stop the intent bubbling to be able to present to user a choice. And then I raise a new intent. 
The weird point is that the dual sim integration to android seems to be done directly in contact app. If I knew how it's done in contact app to send to such or such sim card, I could have a solid clue to understand what's I'm missing (or know that it's not possible to do). Because, unfortunately, if it's done a crappy way, it's possible that doing the integration the way I do is impossible.</p>

<p>Is the rom you are using on this phone opensource? (and what phone model it is?). Or do you know if there is some AOSP alternative to the rom you are using that support multiple sim cards. I did a quick search on cyanogen mod and didn't find anything about dual sim cards in ContactUtils (that seems to manage the dual sim in logs).</p></markdown-widget>

The modded android cyanogen is probably heavely modded :) by the phonedeveloper, and they don't leave out there source.ViewSonic sells a dualsim androidphone in Europe and elsewhere right now. I think dualsim will be more common in the future, which is good to force teloperators to  more honest,adult callrates.
Could you tell me about the workaround, I've tried everything with the filters with no luck. Call directly should be the right filter to use, but it not work.
What setup will result in the setResultData.</p></markdown-widget>
