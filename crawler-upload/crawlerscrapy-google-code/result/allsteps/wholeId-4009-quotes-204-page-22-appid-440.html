1. Register SIP provider, test incoming call, everything works
2. Try to make a call</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
The screen shows calling, and after 31 or 32 seconds every time, fails. The call is never received at the other end.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Tested both 01-01 and the 25 Mar nightly. Same problem on both. Phone is a Nexus One running CyanogenMod-6.1.1-N1, Android version 2.2.1.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
CSipSimple was working fine when I first installed it. I've tried clearing all settings, but that didn't seem to improve the situation. I am behind a NAT router on both my home wifi and on my 3G connection. I enabled STUN and ICE, but still no further forward. I can hear and be heard on incoming calls, but am completely unable to make outgoing calls. I've attached a logfile in case that helps (it was made with version 0.01-01 before STUN was enabled, but the problem was the same. I tried to read the log but couldn't make sense of it.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>No that's not a bug. It's something missing in your configuration.</p>

<p>I'll try to explain you what is happening and give you keys to solve the problem.</p>

<ul>
<li>You are probably trying to use expert account to configure csipsimple and have probably removed "proxy" field content.</li>
<li>Your sip server does not support TCP transport.</li>
</ul>

<p>As consequence what is happening :
when you dial sip:x@x.com it use standard SIP to contact remote side. As there is not the proxy field with ;transport=udp which is the case when there is a proxy field with transport set to UDP, as per SIP RFC pjsip/csipsimple use UDP by default, <em>excepted</em> if the UDP packet size is too big ! (it do that cause routers does not like heavy UDP packets). 
And unfortunately here is the problem in your case UDP packet size becomes too big. As consequence it fallback to UDP and your sip server probably does not manage this very well.</p>

<p>I think that when you tried to remove one of the two PCMa/u codec you have reduced packet size just enough to get pjsip always choosing UDP. You could have removed any other codec I think that you'll get exactly the same result.</p>

<p>So now as for solutions... 
 * Well I bet your sip server does not manage all codecs that CSipSimple can handle. For example silk is probably not supported by your server (or if so your are very lucky ;) ). As it's not an Asterisk with the bug of speex multifrequency, you can also choose only one frequency for speex (depending on your bandwidth). All this codec choose will reduce packet size.
 * In nightly builds there is a new coool option.. In settings &gt; network &gt; use compact form. It will activate light form for sip headers and SDP announce and will drastically reduce packet size. I guess that's supported by OpenSER (your server). I do know yet how widely this option could be supported by sip providers but it's in SIP RFC. I'll probably do a pool to see if I should not activate it by default.
 * Last point you could use your sip provider as proxy (if they support it... usually they do either on the same server than the registrar or on another server).</p>

<p>Hope it will solve your issue. Let me know how it goes but regarding logs I'm almost sure ;).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the detailed response.</p>

<p>By setting data to UDP only, enabling the proxy and disabling STUN, I'm able to make calls, but only to some numbers. It's very strange. If I call a number beginning +447 or +448 it works, but numbers beginning +441 or +442 +443 don't work. But, on both sipdroid and Linphone (on the same device), I can call all numbers and it works fine.</p>

<p>I've contacted localphone.com asking if there is any difference in how numbers are handled at their end. Can you suggest anything else to try? I'd really like to get CSipSimple working fully as it's my preferred SIP client. I love the dialler integration, presenting all the choices in one menu is great. Handling multiple SIP profiles, dialler / history integration make it awesome. :-)</p></markdown-widget>

CSipSimple/pjsip use strict sip uri and actually send + sign to the server. If it helps there is the rewriting rules that may help you to automatically rewrite if dialing from contact / native dialer.</p>

<p>I don't know what exactly made it work, among all the settings I changed in CSIPSimple, so you may want to try all of these:
* Create a new account using the "Basic" wizard.
* Then change the wizard that account to "Advanced". Set the Caller Id and the proxy (proxy.localphone.com).
* Go to "Media" -&gt; "Codecs" and move "PCMA" above "PCMU" (in both "Wideband" and "Narrowband"). This is the default order in SIPdroid.</p>

<p>Also note that I have STUN enabled (using "sip:stun.ekiga.net") but you might not need it.</p>

<p>I found it very hard to get CSIPsimple to work with Localphone, compared to other desktop and mobile SIP clients I've tried, but I have to say it seems like the best client for Android. :)</p></markdown-widget>

Or what you get when you transform your account to an "expert" account.
Then with that I can create a wizard that automatically set up everything. </p>

<p>That's usually the approach I use in csipsimple because each sip providers has it's own needs and it's own way to name things. Some require one username + one authentication name, other use username and auth name as the same value.... and so on. So usually it's some say me, that's too much complicated to configure for this provider... I just add a wizard for this sip provider that optimize the client for this provider. The best is when the sip provider directly contact me and say me exactly what are the best setting for their service (and many do that and they are welcome ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>With Localphone, the SIP username and password are different from those people use to log in. Localphone automatically generates the SIP credentials.</p>

<p>Here's what I get after converting the wizard to expert:</p>

<ul>
<li>Account id: John Smith </li>
<li>Registration URI: sip:localphone.com</li>
<li>Realm: *</li>
<li>Username: LOCALPHONE_SIP_ID</li>
<li>Data (password): LOCALPHONE_SIP_PASSWORD</li>
<li>Data Type: Plain password.</li>
<li>Scheme: digest</li>
<li>Transport: Auto. (I know they don't support TCP; I've always tried UDP)</li>
<li>Publish enabled: unchecked.</li>
<li>Register timeout: 300</li>
<li>Force contact: (empty)</li>
<li>Allow contact rewrite: checked.</li>
<li>Contact rewrite method: Normal.</li>
<li>Proxy URI: sip:proxy.localphone.com</li>
<li>SRTP mode: Disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE: I was just about to send this comment, when I decided to give it another try and it's broken again: I can call +447 numbers but not +441. Could it be because of the wizard change?</p>

<p>Cheers.</p></markdown-widget>
