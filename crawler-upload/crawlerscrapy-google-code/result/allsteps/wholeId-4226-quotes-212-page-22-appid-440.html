1.Turn on wireless
2.Enable STUN
<b>3.</b></p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>Expected Output -- SIP Registered</p>

<p>What I see -- with STUN not enabled it registers some of the time...user can hear me but I can't hear them...</p>

<p>After reading bunch of threads and FAQ I tried Enabling STUN</p>

<p>What I see -- "Fail to add media transport"</p>

<p>I tried a bunch of the public STUN servers...some will actually register but same issue of user hears me but I can't hear them...</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>According to help it's 0.00-16 r410
O/S -- Android 2.2 on HTC EVO</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>If I disconnect from wireless and just run 3G everything runs normal...i can hear them and they can hear me...</p>

<p>NOTE: this is at work...on 2 separate wireless networks...one goes through a sonicwall firewall and the rest of my internal network...
the other is over a linksys router (wrt54g) that goes directly to internet...</p>

<p>are there any free windows based sip clients that i can install on my pc to test and see if it's a wireless or network issue? <br>
At home I was having very similar issues (linksys e3000 router)...but when i used STUN.3CX.com it appeared to work fine over wireless...that STUN server didn't fix it at work though...still getting "fail to add media transport"</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For the fail to add media transport, under certain network configuration the latest builds helped on lot some users with the same issue :
it's probably more reliable (all the more so as I've disabled QoS which improve things on some networks but is not supported by other networks or make things unstable).</p>

<p>In those situations I noticed that stun sometimes fail in silence (there is another open issue to fix that). So maybe both error you observe are linked.</p>

<p>So, could you try that : <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a> and let me know how it goes?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>So for your internal network. My first question is did you succeed to register? With CSipSimple or any other SIP application? - good opensource candidates for android are linphone or sipdroid. 
Just be ensure that when running one SIP app there is not another that is running (even in ghost background) cause all SIP apps usually use the same network ports and it can conflicts.</p>

<p>If it fails with other sip clients too, there is a list of things to check in your firewall / wifi router to ensure SIP packets are not blocked somewhere. But if you get registered problem is probably due to some configuration that should be changed in CSipSimple (it will maybe be needed to switch to expert account mode and force some options for example removing proxy or disabling contact rewrite option).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Well what you could try is to follow this instructions :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ#I_receive_calls_twice_/_Registration_is_done_on_the_sip_server_t">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ#I_receive_calls_twice_/_Registration_is_done_on_the_sip_server_t</a></p>

<p>The section "I receive calls twice / Registration is done on the sip server twice" .</p>

<p>And also removing contents of the "proxy field" (once your account is transformed into an expert account). </p>

<p>Also worth to check that transport is UDP. I assume so cause it's now the default and as you probably use Basic wizard to create the account it should be properly set. But worth to check that too :).</p>

<p>With that done I'd be also interested by logs. There is an easy way -- if it works ;) -- to collect logs. Read HowToCollectLogs wiki page.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Can you confirm me that you changed CSipSimple UDP local binding port to 5966? Is there a reason? Or was it just a try? Maybe worth to try with 5060 or something really higher.

I think that the interesting one I get is the one of #4 : STUN disabled, UDP.
The first register get a response from your server. Then the sip stack automatically try to update the registration to provide SIP server your public IP instead of your IP in the sub-network area. 
This is not done when using STUN cause with STUN the first register is already sent with the public IP address. </p>

<p>And then when registering with the public IP address, we get no response from the server. I think that your router get the response but do not transmit it. The firewall probably block re-entrant sockets.</p>

<p>So I've search over the web and found a really interesting hint :
<a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Linksys+WRT54G">http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Linksys+WRT54G</a>
[quote] : """
NOTE: There is a known SIP registration problem with the WRT54G v5 &amp; v6 with firmware versions below 1.00.6~~:
A bug in the Linksys/VxWorks firmware version 1.00.6 on the WRT54G v5 and v6 can cause SIP registrations to fail regardless of NAT settings in Asterisk or on the phone/ATA. This has been verified with a Cisco 7940 running SIP 6.3 and with X-Lite. Updating to the latest firmware will fix the problem.

<p>Can you check what is the firmware version of your wrt54g? It sounds a really good candidate :)</p></markdown-widget>

Device: Motorola Atrix 4G and Acer Iconia A500 tablet.
Network: ADSL modem-&gt;wireless router-&gt;both devices. Both modem and wireless router has Qos off and NAT on. This problem doesn't exist when using an integrated ADSL wireless modem (However, that modem is dead). 
Behavior: Register timeout on both devices (Atrix and A500). Atrix 4G is able to register over 3G network or using SIPDroid over Wifi (but SIPDroid not usable due to a bug in Atrix 4G's audio library), also tried Mac application telephony, works fine.
To me, it looks like maybe a network problem, seems like response from SIP server is not received by the application (NAT not translated correctly?). 
I tried nightly build, and stable build from market. Both are the same. 
STUN, DNS Srv on, or off doesn't seem to make difference. 
SIP provider is Slingshot, New Zealand. </p>

<p>I can register and place/receive calls from anywhere (no matter cellular network or wifi) while being registered from outside to my own Fritz!Box, except one network: My Mother's. It's the same Fritz!Box model (7170, latest firmware) that I am using at home, but something seems to be wrong with it, because it doesn't support QOS. If I turn the QOS option on in the network setting of CSIPSimple on my Samsung Galaxy S2 (rooted Android 4.0.3), CSIPSimple is suddenly dead, saying this:</p>

<p>Fail to add media transport Received no response from STUN server (PJLIB_UTIL_ESTUNNOTRESPOND)</p>

<p>Turning QOS back off fixes that issue. This is reproduceable.</p>
