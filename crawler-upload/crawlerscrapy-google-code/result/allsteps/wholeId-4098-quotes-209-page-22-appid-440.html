                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>The chooser you get is the stock chooser from Android when multiple apps can handle the same intent. (here the priviledge call intent).</p>

<p>My approach is not to register to this intent like skype does cause I consider that's a crappy way to do that. That's not userfriendly at all and it does not respect others apps on the phone and that lead to a really worse integration to the phone.</p>

<p>So, if you choose "Phone", you'll see that then, you'll have the CSipSimple popup allowing you to choose between your configured sip accounts, gsm, (and even better now also skype if detected on the phone).</p>

<p>You will also notice that on the first popup you have there is a little checkbox "remember my choice". I'd advise you to select it before pressing "Phone".
Btw, you'll always use the clever android integration done by csipsimple.</p>

<p>CSipSimple will propose you to call only when SIP is available, and even better, it's configurable using filtering rules (see csipsimple settings)... And even better than better, you'll be able to add rules for skype and sipgate choice....</p>

<p>I could make exactly the same crappy integration than the one done by Skype and Sipgate... but I think that's really worse than some smart integration to the system that does not always popup you something but only when it's possible or configured to do it.
However, if you really really wants this weird integration to the android system that register to priviledge intents instead of just outgoing calls intent, I'd advise you to make your own build of csipsimple, there is a simple block of lines to uncomment in the manifest file. (I do it for the archos edition when there is no telephony application to integrate to, and in this case, and only in this one it's better to hook at the priviledged time and completly bypass the telephony application).</p></markdown-widget>

thanks for your answer and your great software. I understand your thinking and like it a lot.</p>

<p>But, there is one major flaw in all of that I discovered after playing around with it a while.</p>

<p>I am using Gingerbread (v.2.3.2). This also offers sip phone capability.</p>

<p>When I "integrate into Android", I choose a contact and press "phone" I get to choose between Phone(sip) and CSipSimple(ip).</p>

<p>So in other words I cannot make any real sim phone calls any more, while having csipsimple integrated!</p>

<p>I also get some errors: fail to add media transport Received no response....
I am using sipgate. I set the stun server.</p>

<p>Regards

<p>I've a nexus S and I'm able to do it ;).</p>

<p>Just choose csipsimple when it ask you between sip or csipsimple. Then CSipSimple will propose you between a SIP account or GSM !!! </p>

<p>So again, in the first window... just choose "remember my choice" and choose csipsimple. You'll not be annoyed anymore with the stock SIP app.</p>

<p>In the future csipsimple will integrate the stock sip app as a possible sip stack instead of the one currently used (pjsip).
So they will not have any disavantage to choose "always use" csipsimple instead of the stock sip app.</p>

<p>Just try it... press on csipsimple row... you'll see the next popup that is managed by csipsimple (the first one is managed by the android system that detect that both the stock SIP app and CSipSimple can do the same action)... you'll see... you'll be able to make a gsm call :)</p>

<p>Also in android settings you can change the way the SIP calls of the stock sip apps registers to the system. So another way to not put into conflict csipsimple and the stock SIP app of android 2.3 that do the same thing. Both do a clean integration to android so they register the same intent so when android detect that two apps can do the same thing, it ask user which it should use.
You experiment the same thing when writting a mail and have gmail + the stock app. Or when you install a different home launcher and press the home button....</p></markdown-widget>

you really seem to know a lot about this. Very impressive.</p>

<p>One question thou:
After reading your last post I get the feeling the sip client inside of Gingerbread (Android 2.3) is all I really need.</p>

<p>But:
I've tried your tool and the sound quality was amazing. No delay and even with EDGE I still was able to talk clearly.</p>

<p>With the gingerbread stack sip client I couldn't even change any settings concerning UMTS,EDGE,WLAN, ...</p>

<p>So if you are going to exchange your sip stack for the gingerbread stack. Won't you make it less good?</p>

<p>I hope that in the future gingerbread stack will be better. As consequence adding a binding on it is interesting. Also having this feature would allow custom ROMs (or official roms... who knows... maybe a google engineer read that ;) ) to use pjsip + csipsimple in remplacement to the stock gingerbread stack.</p>
