even if you hear something, it doesn't mean that bluetooth is activated - just that the BT headset is used as a AD2P headset (so without micro). You should also try with audio frequency set to 8kHz (that's more supported by BT SCO).
You have also to know that there is an awful bug in android 2.2 (that they solved in 2.2.1) in bluetooth, and that on some devices BT and Wifi interfere so things becomes really instable using BT + a voip app over wifi).</p>

<p>What is strange is that in 0.00-15-11 I've use my pbxes.org account to solve a problem that was exactly about end call. And seems that pbxes.org servers doesn't support simplified uris. But now with my recent changes should be fixed (at least using my account it's fixed).</p>

<p>Are you sure you reproduce for both incoming and outgoing calls (and not only for outgoing)?
And on what kind of other extension are you trying to call? Is there a configured trunk to another provider? (If so maybe could make sense to directly configure csipsimple to use this other account to test without pbxes.org between)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I tested it now with .12, and it seems to work again. Actually I had lots of problems with BT, I thought it's because of the Bluetooth device I bought (Nokia BH-214), I ordered another (Sony Ericsson MW600) to test that one. But I saw you removed a lot of settings with the new build, why? With .15 I saw I could edit the mic and earpieve amplification, that options are gone. Like I said, I have this echo problem with my Samsung i9000, and it seems its because the earpiece or the mic is too loud or not good enough shielded. I just tested around with .15 and set both gains to 0.1, and that removed the echo, expect that the mic is very quiet now.</p></markdown-widget>

  <p>What does Android audio stream setting do?
  Nothing on galaxy S. On all other android device (that has not this crappy driver from samsung), it's the ~clean~ way to set the listening sound level.
  On latest builds you can change the amplification during call (use volume buttons).</p>

<p>I'd be really interested by logs about the first issue you reported.
In last dev version there is a facility in Menu &gt; Help to activate log recording... then reproduce the problem... then go back in help and press stop recording and it will ask you to send me the logs directly.</p></markdown-widget>

-I can definitely tell you, that 0.4 &amp; 0.2 results in a bad echo for my i9000, it's the international version not the US one, maybe that's the reason? I've tested it, and the only settings 'working' are 0.2 mic and 0.1 ear.</p>

<p>On latest builds you can change the amplification during call (use volume buttons).
-I saw that, but its useless without any text values, maybe you can add those? That it shows the gain, without any text I cannot adjust during call.</p>

<p>Well, about logs I'm wondering something : you are maybe using the record call feature (which record a .wav file of the conversation) and not the Log record feature.
Log record feature is in the main CSipSimple dialer, press menu Help &gt; Activate log recording (or something like that, just under the FAQ line).</p>

<p>If you can't use this feature, you can still follow the old instruction (HowToCollectLogs)</p></markdown-widget>

HowToCollectLogs It would really help me!</p>

<p>I'm absolutely not fan of the sipdroid UI with sliding. It's not common UI scheme on android while the end call button is exactly the same behavior that the stock android phone application.
The only slide there to end call is when your device doesn't support proximity sensor and the UI is just like the froyo lock slider.</p>

<p>Besides, I plan to add a much more powerful drag and drop feature to manage call end, hold call and conferencing.... stay tuned ;). So would be incompatible with this slide to bottom to end call behavior.</p>

<p>Just un-learn every bad reflex you had took with sipdroid... their integration with the android system is far to be good (IMHO), and there is a much more user friendly way to manage things. (for example integration with android stock contacts etc).</p></markdown-widget>

Actually CSipSimple can run to be "always available".
If so it remains in background and try to keep the socket this the server alive. It consume CPU time.</p>

<p>If you set csipsimple to be "only for ougoing call" it will potentially be in background but will not run at all (android manage application itself and put some application up in memory while they don't consume any CPU time).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>On my nexus one, even in mode run in background, top give a CPU of 0%....
Wondering so maybe something else particular to your configuration :</p>

<ul>
<li>Some sip server send you a lot of sip messages (some sip servers send keep alive messages besides of csipsimple messages).</li>
<li>Check if lock CPU is not set to on in settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Else try to do a ps -t 37821 where 37821 is the PID of csipsimple.
It may help to see what are the threads associated to CSipSimple tehre is maybe something to see interesting doing that. Maybe some audio thread is still running.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For keep alive setting : transform your account into an expert account, you'll see all settings to tune the behavior of the keep alive (and re-register timeout) for this account.
(Just for info, the application is really tunable but that's for power users, for main stream I keep things hidden... and should remain hidden for main stream... the approach is to get optimized things for main stream users but provide a way for power users to change settings).</p>

<p>However again, on my phone I don't see such an activity (and with default options).
My guess is that it is your SIP server (your provider) that frequently send you some "Option" or another packet that make the activity alive.
This could be easily detected with logs.
You can also try to reboot your phone, in the doubt could maybe help, but my first thought is about a talkative SIP registrar. </p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Keep alive is <em>not</em> a global setting that's a setting relative to an account !!! So it has to be set into accounts settings. That's absolutely logic. Other sip software doesn't support multiple accounts... So everything is mixed in the interface.... Here you have settings about the account and global settings. It's separated.</p>

<p>In global settings there is a basic mode (the easy setting line) (for main stream users that don't know everything about SIP). There is the advanced mode, the three other lines. And the expert mode (press menu and switch to expert).</p>

<p>In accounts there is the same thing, Basic account (or any branded wizard), Advanced account and expert account. And you can switch from a wizard to another.
To transform an account that's pretty simple : 
Long clic on the account row. And select "choose wizard" and choose expert.</p>

<p>I don't use pbxes.org. In most of cases that's absolutely useless and you can directly plug to your true SIP provider. (SipDroid which is developed mainly by pbxes.org advise to use their service, but SIP is <em>not</em> only pbxes.org. (There is advantages to use their service indeed, but that's not absolutely required).</p>

<p>Try to understand, you are trying to do things that a power user do. It's normal that the interface is more complicated for you. If you were just a mainstream user, you'd don't want to bother with these strange settings... That's the reason why there is many level of interface.
Think about that, you don't succeed in creating an expert account while for somebody that know about sip it is absolutely possible all the more so as the pbxes.org wizard actually create an expert account, just like all other accounts. 
I could have done only the expert wizard... but you and a lot of other users would have been absolutely lost. </p></markdown-widget>
