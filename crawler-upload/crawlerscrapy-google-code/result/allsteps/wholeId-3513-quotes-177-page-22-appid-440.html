1. Install r1055, no matter whether through a clean install, or over a previous release.
2. Accounts stay 'inactive' (yellow bar under icon).
<b>3.</b></p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Registration, as usual.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
r1055 on a Motorola Defy flashed with Gingerbread.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
The first time I installed r1055, the issue appeared. Then, as the previous version I had changed CSS from a user application to a system one, through Titanium Backup, I changed CSS back to user. Then, registration occured (that's when I posted a comment on issue 1333), but it didn't last long. Now, no matter what I do (log out and back in, kill process, reboot phone), can't make any of my accounts go to the 'active' state.</p></markdown-widget>

I mean, there is no retention of the mic source and audio mode settings (in fact, it seems to happens to all other settings), unless CSS is killed in the setting page, in order to have them correctly stored. There was a slight change in the mic source when talking through the phone. In r1051 it had to be set to VOICE_COMMUNICATION. Now it must be set to MIC.

<p>It can at least explain the reset of settings, but could also explain other problems with audio restoration after a call (that is needed for bluetooth).</p>

<p>It will take me some time to re-implement something to workaround the fact android is not safe about that. I've to rework entierly the way settings are retrieved/saved from the UI :S </p></markdown-widget>

<p>Well, I'm pretty sure you'll come up with brilliant solutions soon. You rock!</p>

As the different settings requirements for using either the phone's earpiece+mic or a blueotooth headset still remains (issue introduced in one of the last bunch of builds), the first time I tried to change the mic source setting, CSS locked my Defy horribly, requiring removal and reinsertion of the battery pack. Glad that this big issue has not appeared again. One thing I noticed when using a bluetooth headset is that, if I turn the headset off and back on, CSS doesn't detect it. I have to repeat those operations for it to work. Anyway, you've done a very good job, Regis. Congratulations!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I'll try to disable noise suppressor of webRTC to see how it goes without on your device. </p>

<p>It will be in r1088 that will be built tonight. If you can make some test when you get some time with webRTC echo mode enabled on r1088 (or upper if I do another change meanwhile ;) ) would be great. 
Also, I'd be interested by your current frequency/clock rate setting. As it may impact the way webRTC AEC work it is an interesting parameter sto try to reproduce on my low cpu device :)</p>

<p>In fact, I planned to release something on android market soon, so feedback on this point is very valuable :). I'd rather prefer not release something that will break things for many users ;).</p></markdown-widget>
