For the callcentric account, did you use the Callcentric wizard or the basic one?</p>

<p>If using the basic wizard it produces something that could lead the application to loop trying to register (because callcentric doesn't support some kind of registration).
The dedicated callcentric wizard (it's maybe in other countries section) configure the account so that it doesn't use the new kind of registration and so it doesn't lead the app to loop trying to register.</p></markdown-widget>

My default provider account is not callcentric.  It is with

work, it will register and connect too.  I have another account which
also did not register during this weird state</p>

The second log method to log to files instead of android log is more interesting for this purpose. It produces file on the sdcard. The only thing is to remember to deactivate it once finish to not remain one entiere month with it activated. For 1 week it will produce reasonable amount of logs. Then you can remove logs files from the sdcard.</p>

<p>To activate this log method :

However it is not yet bulletproof.  I have two occasions getting something similar to it.  But the weird state these two times I am getting is a bit better than before at least the provider status indicated registration failure and prompted in red.  Before it was always on green even though you could not connect.  The symptoms are similar - refuse to reconnect until I kill the app with taskkiller.  </p>

<p>It now happens very rarely but I think it may have to do with back-to-back wifi re-connections because of weak signal.  The subsequent establishment of connection may have left CSS confused.  I will try to catch this with logging again.  Maybe hard but worth a try</p></markdown-widget>
