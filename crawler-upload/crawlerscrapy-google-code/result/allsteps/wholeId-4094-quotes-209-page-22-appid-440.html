1.Making and receiving calls</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Normal conversation. Microphone acting out of the ordinary.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Development version on Android 2.2</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>I may have discovered what the problem might be with the microphone issue on Samsung Galaxy S series. When making a call, there are basically 4 different modes - 2 for the speaker and 2 for the microphone. When making a normal call, the phone is supposed to go into "non-speakerphone mode" where the incoming audio is sent to the earpiece and the microphone is on "short distance" mode. When on a speakerphone mode, the incoming audio is supposed to be sent to the outside speaker and the microphone is supposed to be set at "sensitive mode" where the user can talk at a distance.</p>

<p>When csipsimple is on "normal mode," the incoming audio is sent to the earpiece like it's supposed to do. However, the microphone is set at speakerphone mode where the outgoing audio is amplified to pick up voices from a distance. This obviously creates problems because now the outgoing audio is "overdeviating" and sounds are garbled. Every surrounding sound is picked up where the other party has difficulty making out what the caller is saying.</p>

<p>In order to solve this problem, csipsimple needs to properly set the microphone to "normal" mode when making or receving calls. It is not simply solved by using a third party audio management software. It is an inherent audio routing problem for the microphone which I believe could be solved by modifying the software.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>That would explain why I need to reduce micro amplification with SGS.</p>

<p>However on thing you have to know.... Samsung android audio drivers are crappy.... Here is status of my research on sgs.</p>

<p>Actually to get the sound routing through the earpiece instead of speaker what I do is a weird workaround, that fortunately work with SGS and that's just an awful workaround. I switch to IN_CALL mode and then back to NORMAL_MODE.
As far as I understood from the Samsung approach the NORMAL_MODE route everything to speaker (and probably as you said use the far distance micro mode), while IN_CALL mode route to earpiece and use the proper micro mode....</p>

<p>However ... in IN_CALL mode, samsung just does not send micro packets to the application ! I think that it is directly send to the GSM chipset for telephony mode... but a third party application can't record in this mode ! 
I think so, cause some implementor from another manufacturer said me that they do that (also based on an alsa driver) but they provided me a way to have a SIP_MODE for audio which solve issues and is optimized.</p>

<p>As consequence, for a third party application, in SGS, I think that it is impossible to get the short distance mode working. At least with official ROM from samsung. Maybe custom ROMs could help?</p>

<p>If you are involved or can ask directly SGS ROM developpers, and you want to test in_call routing mode, there is many workaround options available in csipsimple. </p>

<p>Usually that's for samsung devices, cause what they do is a surprise at each device... the only device correct they did is the Nexus S but I think that's cause google helped them with the audio driver and need the audio driver to be descent to support the stock SIP application.</p>

<p>Have a look here :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ#Audio_routing_troubleshooting">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ#Audio_routing_troubleshooting</a>
For tweaking audio routings methods.</p>

<p>So unless Samsung fix their rom, I think that it is impossible to do. However if you'd like to play with the csipsimple code, you'll be welcome. 
But I spent a lot of time with SGS (and I own one now), and the only workaround I found is this one (and I shared it with sipdroid developpers, so I guess all sip application use this workaround to get something working on SGS).</p>

<p>(I hope that if sipdroid guys have found something else they would have shared it with me cause when I find the workaround I posted on their issue list my findings).</p></markdown-widget>
