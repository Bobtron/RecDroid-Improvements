It sounds like a very big problem. Something like a break in timer api introduced in Android SDK :(. This android version is definitely one that breaks everything... without any prior announcement from Google :(</p>

<p>I will need to reproduce on my dev environment to fix it. so I have to wait for the KitKat update of my nexus 7 to fix it.</p></markdown-widget>

 - Switch to ExpertSettingMode (see wiki page)
 - Go in user interface and change log level to 5.
Press back twice and wait for the 5 minutes (so that logs are produced). With logs level 5 we will see all timers schedules and maybe we will find some clue.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Apparently there is no method to create an exact repeating alarm in 4.4.
The workaround is mentioned in this article (link above). Maybe you are not
seeing it in the emulator because there is no event batching in the
emulator.</p>

The doc states :
"""
Applications whose targetSdkVersion is earlier than API 19 will continue to see the previous behavior in which all alarms are delivered exactly when requested. 
"""
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html</a></p>

<p>Of course, when we will upgrade to api 19 as target we will take that into account. But it's not yet done.
(Android always did this way which is very good for api evolution). But from your description (and if you are using a build I provide), the statement they announce in the doc (and that was expected as they always do this way) is wrong. And they did something that hard break existing apps. That's why I'm pretty afraid of this problem and why I mentioned the break in the timer api.</p>

<p>For reference, the other thing they broke and required me to do an upgrade was about a permission they removed. On this topic (permissions), they are doing transition less seamlessly and I was not so surprised to have a hotfix to do.</p></markdown-widget>

So when you go in settings &gt; user interface &gt; log level &gt; 5.
Just press back twice to go back to csipsimple dialer (or android launcher) and wait enough so that we can see that the timer is never launched by android system (with your configuration ~ 5 minutes should be fine).

The first thing is that the timer is launched by Android system. This is something very good as it eliminates the possible api break we evoked previously.
The second thing is that I see a log indicating CSipSimple tries to disconnect before the timer is launched. This might be due to a different config you have on your nexus 5. Can you check in CSipSimple settings that WiFi is available for incoming and confirm me that you do not quit the app using 'disconnect' menu option but does with the back key of the phone?
The third thing, and it sounds like a bug, is that the app does not disconnect fully as it should. Besides, there is symptoms that makes me think there is a dead lock.
However it would be strange that this bug is linked to the android version. It looks more like a combination of account settings leading to this case.
That's why, if you have time, it would be great if you can try different expert account setting. The first thing that might eliminate some steps and simplifies registration is to disable mwi. Disabling 'allow contact rewrite' could be interesting too. If there is other features that are not mandatory for your server it could be interesting to disable sequentially these features and see if one is the root cause of the problem. (for example using UDP etc etc).There is maybe also general options that could affect registration process.</p></markdown-widget>

<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=2551">https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=2551</a></p>

<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=2549&amp;can=1&amp;q=320044">https://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=2549&amp;can=1&amp;q=320044</a></p>

<p>You can solve this by forcing IPV 4. </p>

<p>These instructions are for the Android OS, not within CSipsimple.
1. Go to settings
2. Wireless &amp; Network &gt; More
3. Mobile networks
4. Access Point Names
5. Select T-Mobile GPRS (fast.t-mobile.com) or your selected carrier.
6. Click on APN Protocol (by default it's set to use IPv6)
7. Select IPv4/Ipv6
8. Exit out of settings.</p>

<p>However, this is still a bug with the UA not being able to handle IPV6. This may be merged into issue 2549</p></markdown-widget>
