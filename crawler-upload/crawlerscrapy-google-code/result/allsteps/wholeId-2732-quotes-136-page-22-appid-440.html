<p>The proximity sensor feature uses a non public API from android (it's something found from core android source code). So it's highly possible Google changed it in 4.2 and breaks the current implementation. I would not be so surprised.</p>

<p>Until android 4.2 source code is released it will be hard to solve the problem (or until I get a 4.2 device with a proximity sensor and can try to reverse engineer it).</p>

<p>Sorry for the inconvenience meanwhile, but I can't do better until google decide to put it as a public and reliable API so that we will not need to dig into android source code to find how to have it in VoIP applications.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>A new nightly build will be produced automatically in about 2 hours. You will be able to test the fix by upgrading from :
<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a></p>

<p>You have to wait for a version with version &gt;= r2014 to appear on the bottom of the list. It usually finish at 00:34/00:36 for my timezone (France).</p>

<p>Let me know how it goes. Even if it should be fine, I was only able to test on Nexus 7 which has no proximity sensor. 
The only thing I'm sure of is that it will now try to detect the presence of proximity sensor wake lock properly (and was the point were private API changed).
Normally the rest of the private API didn't changed so it should be fine after this done, but if you can confirm it will be great because I still fear about some new restriction with apps permissions :)</p>

<p>About Viber : probably because they do not try to check if the device supports the proximity sensor and just launch the lock without being sure of the result.
It's not clean and may have unexpected very bad results on devices without proximity sensors.</p>

<p>But as it's a proprietary app they probably don't bother with minority devices and just target most device that has bigger market share. 
It is not the case of csipsimple as an opensource that tries to gives access to voip to all without forcing all contacts to use a single service provider and all users to buy same devices.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>So if you are interested in the technical part : The android stock phone app :
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Phone/+/5c24ba2eaee30b1eb232b3a22a925240d25857fc/src/com/android/phone/PhoneGlobals.java">https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Phone/+/5c24ba2eaee30b1eb232b3a22a925240d25857fc/src/com/android/phone/PhoneGlobals.java</a></p>

<p>It's line 493.
It's private API of PowerManager class that needs to be solved using Java reflexion.
mPowerManager.isWakeLockLevelSupported() had previously a different name (previous approach was to get some flags and compare).</p>

<p>If viber (or another app) do not this check as it's done and was done using previous method it's very risky. Because they use a private API (which is already risky) and beside use it without reading actual code of google doing that;.... they maybe just found some hint on stackoverflow and didn't try to search the source. (many developers thinks stackoverflow is a reliable source ... even in big companies lol).</p></markdown-widget>

And most probably you are right about viber getting the hint from stackoverflow :))
They have many issues in every android update, the last one was the contacts issue that prevented the app from loading on ics or jb I can't remember exactly.</p>

<p>Does this by any chance is related to the fact that my Galaxy Nexus after updating to the latest Android 4.2 by an image obtained from Google does not turn off the screen while making Skype calls and it feels as if the Proximity Sensor is not working? The only way I can get the phone to shut the screen during making a call is by locking it from the hard lock key on the side of the phone.</p>

The version from nightly build repository <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/CSipSimple-latest-trunk.apk">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/CSipSimple-latest-trunk.apk</a> fixes the issue. 
However, it obviously fix it only for csipsimple and has nothing to do with skype app. Skype is a different app and if you want it to be fixed in skype, Skype needs to fix it in their app.</p>

<p>Some side note about skype : it's a proprietary software/service and you can't study their source code. They also handcuff their users to their service and application and you can't use their service from other apps. 
You also need your friends to use their service as well and you handcuff your friends to accept their conditions to communicate with you. 
I usually advise users to think about their freedom when they choose skype and think twice about what they ask to their friends. Communication is too important to be left to proprietary world, it should be open and you should be able to communicate to anyone whatever the service they choose, just like it's possible for emails.
That's one of the goal of SIP and of CSipSimple project (and other opensource SIP clients like linphone, sipdroid, imsdroid etc). That's clearly not the goal of Skype and Microsoft. Their goal is to get more users and handcuff them to their service.</p></markdown-widget>
