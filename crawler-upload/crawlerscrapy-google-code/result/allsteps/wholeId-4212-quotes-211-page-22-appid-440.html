So the reason of the problem is "normal". (All the more so as some device have a loudspeaker near of the micro or a form factor that amplify this effect).</p>

<p>However, to go against that problem, there is a workaround. It's echo cancellation. By default I set echo cancellation to it's minimal cause it's a feature that consume CPU and on some devices it affect the call quality. On Droid you can try to increase echo cancellation.</p>

<p>I'd advise you to read issue 119. Last comment from ken give an interesting advise on echo cancellation. (Setting echo tail to 100ms and use Speex echo cancellation).
To tweak settings you may have to install on of the latest dev version (see HowToInstallDevVersion wiki page) and to switch to expert global setting mode (see ExpertSettingMode wiki page).</p>

<p>If you have feedback on settings you can reply to issue 119. Any user feedback on echo cancellation settings is welcome ;).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Well as I said, it has been reported several times on some devices. As I do not reproduce on my tests devices it's hard to solve for now. However what you can test and may help is to test audio "hacks" that I provide.
To do so please follow instructions of my comment 2 on issue 553 and let me know how it goes. 
(The issue 553 is about a routing problem but can be audio routing hacks could also solve this kind of problems cause can also be linked to audio routing that is done to nowhere ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>If keep awake while in lock works for you it mean that your device is impacted by the PSP issue.</p>

<p>Keep awake while in call is a well well known work around used for devices such as HTC devices and Dell streak that have the PSP behavior.
This behavior is the following : when screen goes off, the wifi card comes in a state where data packets are not received as frequently as it should. In this case application can do nothing if android version is lower than 2.3. With 2.3 and native SIP google has discovered this behavior -- that voip developpers cried for long time ago... just search psp on this issue list you'll find the ref to the android issue -- and has provided a way for apps to cleanly acquire a lock on wifi.</p>

<p>SO if "keep awake on call" works it <em>IS</em> actually the solution!!! No other workaround can be found and keep awake while in call option is really well supported in csipsimple. 
It's really optimized to lock only resources required, it let the screen goes in dim mode, it uses proximity sensor to add an overlay to avoid you to do unwanted actions. So if it solve the problem it is the good solution. </p>

<p>If it solves the problem it means that I have to activate the "Keep awake on call" by default for your device (I already do for almost all recent HTC device with android &lt; 2.3 and for dell streak). 
To help me to do that by default, I'll need logs provided by my embbeded tool. Read the wiki page HowToCollectLogs .</p></markdown-widget>

<p>But I think that the fact it works finally is due to the fact screen is on when speakerphone is used. So that it's equivalent to have "keep awake while in call" option and route properly things.</p>

<p>Again, keep awake while in call is a well known and supported workaround. It is really needed in some case and it's normal to have to activate that. There is very good technical reason for that.</p>

<p>I think that even if you toogle speakerphone and let the screen goes off again (using proximity sensor or power off button pressed quickly), you'll get the same result. 
If not motorola did a very weird things with their wifi driver ;) and indeed in this case using what you suggest would be a double workaround that would fortuately work but that would be cause motorola did a weird thing. If it behaves like I guess, what do motorola is not weird, that's just a choice to save battery and to have wifi card entering in PSP mode when screen goes off. The clean workaround for android &lt; 2.3 is "keep awake while in call" and there is a clean solution in android &gt;= 2.3.</p></markdown-widget>
