It's up to VCI to integrate correctly to the system and search accross contacts by it's own. CSipSimple already announce to third party apps by a correct the fact that a call is in progress.</p>

<p>Is voice caller-id opensource? If so I could have a look to the source code and advise the developper what he should fix in his app to support all calls and not only mobile calls.</p>

<p>Else, you can ask VCI developper to ask me if he need helps to do what is required to be informed of <em>ALL</em> calls on the system (not only mobile calls).</p>

<p>But that's not up to CSipSimple to support all third party apps that do things with mobile calls. In this case it's clearly not a problem in CSipSimple... it's simply due to the fact VCI does not support calls other than the ones that trigger TelephonyListener (which manage only moblie calls).</p></markdown-widget>

VCI support seems does not want to do anything - they just don't answer to my requests.
anyway I have one more problem (probably they assotiated with one another) - no signal on incoming sip call in bt earpiece. mobile calls not affected. and I cannot answer with bt (it does not know about incoming call), but if I answer from phone then I can hear and speak with bt.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The last time I tested on my HTC magic with CM I noticed that bluetooth for third party application were not really well managed. 
For example I noticed that connecting BT break the wifi signal which is very annonying for a SIP application but does not impact the standard telephony application.
Besides there is something to be aware of with BT SCO it is that the connection in android is managed by the telephony application. So that it's not a problem for telephony application to handle it properly ;). For third party apps it's more complicated to acquire wifi from the telephony application (cause we depend on the fact telephony application allow us to do that). And in android the real support of BT SCO (with micro capturing) for third party apps is really young (stable only after android 2.2.1).</p>

<p>So for those reason that's not so strange that BT is not very well supported yet on htc magic. However, there is something really important you can test and that can improve things :
In CSipSimple settings goes in media settings and in Frequency set it to 8kHz instead of 16kHz. There is an open issue about that on this issue list. It should be done automatically as soon as BT is detected cause BT SCO only support 8kHz streams.</p>

<p>So try to set frequency to 8kHz it may helps, but I fear that anyway it will be complicated with magic. (And I resent that too cause I also own a htc magic).</p></markdown-widget>

the most strange thing is that few days ago it worked fine! the problem appeared after I did update firmware of my jabra extreme. but I don't think that the problem is in jabra because I tried another earpiece (it supports only telephone profile - not a2dp) that I did use previously and it could signal on incoming sip call - now it cannot.
may I send you log from my phone? probably you could find the root of the problem.</p></markdown-widget>
