1. Both parties connected and talking well</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><p>Internet connection (on mobile running this app) is lost (disconnected from ISP either on wifi or 3G) and no more audio is heard from the other party. </p></li>
<li><p>The END button/function (on screen) does not end the call. Instead it keeps the call screen ON and I have to manually close this program from Task Manager.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Tapping END should end the call, which is already disconnected by disruption in internet connection. or when Internet connection is lost, call should automatically END.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
version 0.02-03</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>In this case, that I am refering, only the availability of internet is lost, wifi and 3G connections are still turned on.
If somehow, internet connection is established in the meantime, the call can be ended by tapping END.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Just guess.</p>

<p>Wifi goes off and then go on again... 
Behaving like that, the connection will not be stopped. Besides, it is actually NOT stopped. Since the remote server/part does not have the information about the fact the call has been ended.</p>

<p>Besides, SIP already has timers about these kind of situation, and when the sip stack will not receive media data for a while, it will automatically stop your communication (and obviously the screen will go off).</p>

<p>So, behaving like you advise, would lead in situation where things are not in a consistant state. So that's not a good idea. 
BTW, if you decide to press hangup and then just press the home button of your phone, it will behaves as you expect. The sip stack will try to send the end call command to the remote side (and will actually do if the wifi comes up again), and will just timeout else.</p>

<p>Waiting for the timeout while on background is not a big problem I think and besides, I would advise, to not kill the application while running cause obviously it will not clean up wifi locks, screen locks and audio layer and may lead to weird state of your phone.</p></markdown-widget>

For my curiosity, I just emulated the exact situation here and it took about 40 seconds  for the call screen to end.
In my case, there are instances when the internet connection is lost and does not come again soon. So, I'll have to wait for more than 40 seconds to get rid of this.
Is this the standard timer? I wish it were shorter...</p>

<p>And also, if I went back to home screen with 'call' still on in status bar and suddenly the 'internet' is back on and if the other party didn't hung up then I would probably miss that call or wouldn't be aware of the call if I put my phone away or on pocket, hoping the call has ended and disconnected.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be problem if I have my headphone on but it is not all the time.</p>

<p>So, I was expecting if this timer thing at apps core can be adjusted or it can be so that the call would automatically end if the connection goes away.</p>

<p>And please note that I would have to tap the END key AGAIN when the internet is back again, no matter how many times I had tapped it when the internet was disconnected.</p></markdown-widget>

<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt</a></p>

<p>(p265 : table 4).
By default pjsip (the sip stack on which csipsimple rely), use the same timeout values 
(see <a href="http://www.pjsip.org/pjsip/docs/html/group__PJSIP__CONFIG.htm#ga20034511855d73140e26847c2220273f">http://www.pjsip.org/pjsip/docs/html/group__PJSIP__CONFIG.htm#ga20034511855d73140e26847c2220273f</a> )</p>

<p>CSipSimple directly use this very reliable sip stack and does not add clever things on the top of that. So even if I would like to changes things it would be very complicated to do and would break the robustness of this sip stack (that is used on many other devices : iphone, pc, mac, .... and that is done by sip experts).
All I could do would be just awful hack.</p>

<p>About the use case of ending call, and then pressing home button, anyway when the phone is in your pocket, if the connection is established back (so within the next 32 seconds), the BYE command will be send to your remote party or if not the remote party will consider (because these timers are normalized in SIP RFC), that the call is ended. So anyway, he will not be in communication with your pocket ;).</p></markdown-widget>
