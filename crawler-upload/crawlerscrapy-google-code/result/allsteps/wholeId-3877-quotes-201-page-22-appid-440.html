CsipSimple is the best sip client on android, but audio quality unfortunately is not the best, at least on some device.
I usually use CsipSimple on 3g, and at the beginning I thought the problem was the connection, probably what I noticed started with the changes in what I think is the "audio driver", to make Samsung Galaxy user experience better.
Also in my case 3CXphone, using pjsip as Regis said, performs better.</p>

<p>On CsipSimple I tried a lot of configuration with codec g.729/gsm with or without echo cancellation, using less cpu as possible, but without the performance of 3cx.</p>

<p>I hope the work on video branch brings gifts also on the audio side.</p>

<p>Thanks</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>@matt : yes stock gsm app can directly bind gsm chipset to micro hardware. It ensure lower latency and better quality.</p>

<p>In fact, the android os prior to android 2.3 is not designed for voip calls. The only thing sip apps do is trying to workaround with the available api.
On android 2.3 things are different. The fact that google introduced a stock sip application also imply that there is now something in the android api to do voice over ip calls. But ... but... manufacturer did not managed that very well, and many of them didn't take the new api into account.
I was very optimistic at the begin with this new api and first I set by default these new settings in csipsimple. Unfortunately I noticed quickly than HTC did incomplete upgrade to 2.3 on this point, and that samsung (as usually with their audio driver), did crappy things.</p>

<p>So, now things are very fuzzy, and I'm not really able to tell for a given device what are the best settings. However, you as user, can try to hack. CSipSimple has an expert setting mode (see the wiki page about that), that allow to tweak how the application use the audio driver.
It should allow you to do everything that can be done with your device. The problem is that there is many options ;)
But worth to try first :
* micro source option : "default" is the legacy one that should work for most device. Then depending on device, "mic" and "camcorder" can correspond to different micro on the device. "voice_call" is the one used for voice calls (on many implementations it plug directly micro to the gsm chipset which mean that the application is not able to get the frames from the micro). "voice_communication" which is valid only for 2.3 and upper, is the one from the new api. According to docs, it should be very good for voice over ip calls, and should even do hardware echo cancellation. For now the only device I found that really do that very well is the acer iconia tab.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mode audio for sip calls : "normal" is the legacy one even if on some device in order to get routing to earpiece it is necessary to use "in_call" (but on other device in_call also plug micro to gsm chipset and the app can't record audio frames from mic). "in_communication" is the mode of the new (android 2.3) api. It should also optimize the way routing is done for voice over ip application.</li>
</ul>

<p>BTW, if you have a look to the stock android application code, you'll notice that the stock sip application use *_communication modes and mic source. So that's the ~good~ way to do things... but unfortunately manufacturer not always added the stock sip application and so not always did a clean implementation of this new api.</p>

<p>Also, what could help is to try with latest version from nightly builds server. It includes a new echo canceller (from google's webRTC project) which should be better. I'll try to add to this echo canceller the noise suppressor from the same project (I have to study how to do that but should be possible and may possibly help with this issue).
Another point, echo canceller can on the other side have bad effect on noise and on micro level. If echo is too high, echo canceller can produce low mic level. In this case, you can try to play with micro amplification option.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these kind of expert option, is really all a sip application can do. Who should be blame for this kind of issue are manufacturers. But anyway, if you find something interesting and think you have settings that should be integrated by default for your device, I can integrate that to the application (this is already done for many many devices cause there is many many different implementations from each manufacturer -- and usually samsung do a new implementation per device ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>
