1. Dial *101*9# in Thailand with DTAC sim card or other USSD code.</p>

<p>What is the expected output?
Pop up window appears displaying network info.</p>

<p>What do you see instead?
Window appears asking which app I want to open - sipdroid or csip but not dialler.  I choose csip - then the standard csip window offering GSM.  Select GSM and *101*9 (missing #) is dialled instead of executing USSD code.  Force quiting csip does not help.  I have to uninstall from my phone before they work.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Csip pre5, Froyo 2.2</p>

<p>I've read their code and the dialer integration use my previous approach that modify currently dialed number adding a # and a tag to specify it is or not pstn call.</p>

<p>Then they split the number with # as separator. The backside of this method is that it doesn't always handle properly # within the number (at least in their case if other application that handle phone number doesn't use the same mechanism).</p>

<p>Sorry I did not include all the finer detail, because it still do the same as described by krolaw, but just for your info I will describe the steps and results again.</p>

<p>I am using CSipsimple 0.00-13 with Froyorider 2.0 Android 2.2 on a Magic 32A</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the mobile icon on CSipsimple top right corner.</li>
<li>Dail *100# and dial button which should give me a popup with my account balance</li>
<li>Popup with selection of IP or mobile, but the top of the popup says "Call *100"</li>
<li>I select "use Mobile"</li>
<li>The phone try to dial *100 and then hang up</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this is the information you needed.</p>

<p>And by the way, this is the best SIP program on the market. Congratulations!!!</p>

<p>Just a thought, is there another sip application -Sipdroid, Linphone, GoogleVoice with integration activated- installed on your phone? 
If there is some other app with the same bug that I had previously, it's possible that the other app rewrite the phone number incorrectly (without encoding # properly) and then pass to CSipSimple the number without the # char.</p></markdown-widget>

However, that's a little bit strange since I've also google voice on my phone and just like you it's impossible for me to start it since my account can't login on google voice (it's not available in France too).
I heard that if I go through the login there is an option in google voice to disable outgoing call integration. But I guess that you are blocked before accessing any option just like me?
However, even if I have google voice installed I have not the problem. Maybe a matter of google voice version. What version of google voice is installed on your phone?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Yes I am blocked for Google Voice. I have root access but I am not that clever. Took me 3 days to get my phone rooted!!!</p>

<p>I just want to mention another issue since installing the latest version. You must redirect this to a new issue or whatever needs to be done if necessary. Since installing the latest version, when making a call the in-call screen is displayed - the one with the end call button in the middle. After about 15 seconds the slide buttons are displayed over the other buttons making it impossible to access the buttons to send like in-call dtmf. To be able to access the dialpad inside a call I have to press the back button, go into notifications, select current call and then I have 15 seconds access to the dialpad again until the sliders are displayed over the buttons again. I thought it could be the option of using slider controls or not but changing the option does not seems to make a difference.</p>

This screen locker is here to avoid your face to make unwanted actions.
I guess that your phone has no proximity sensor since else I use proximity sensor instead of timers to lock screen.
When timer are used, just slide the right yellow locker icon to the left side of the screen (just like you do when answering the call).</p>

<p>The option in setting is related only to the answer mode and not the overlay locker.
So setting use buttons will just change the way you take/decline an incoming call.</p>

<p>For google voice, I was just thinking about that, but it's a bad idea to uninstall it, since Google navigation need it to run (there is probably a dependency with some vocal features).
Just for information, my version of google voice is 0.4.1.261. If you have a lower version, you should maybe consider update it from the market.</p></markdown-widget>
