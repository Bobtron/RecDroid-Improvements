<p>Low bandwidth (3G/GPRS/Edge), need to use a codec optimised for low bandwidth. 
PCMU and PCMA are the worse codecs (cause actually do no compression at all). 
iLBC and g729 should be better regarding data usage and have a good quality (however iLBC use many CPU and g729 is proprietary.
GSM use few bandwidth but provide a not so good call quality (as worse as on real GSM -- it's the same codec used ;) )
speex@8kHz should not use too much bandwidth but is not the best choice (speex 16 and 32 are good if you have a high speed connection)
silk codec (it is the one that Skype use) has very good results @8kHz with low bandwidth.
g722 (only if you have a really high speed connection, but call quality is very good if so).</p>

<p>The important thing in all this list is whether your sip provider does actually support this codec or not ! Cause if they do not unfortunately, there is few thing a sip app can do ;).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Actually it should. The default order in CSipSimple, for low bandwidth (narrowband) and wideband should be good as far as the remote side manage it correctly.
Unfortunately some providers / sip gateway does not manage some codec implementation very well and as consequence even if the application does it best to announce codecs in the best order and that negociation succeed, if the other side do weird things with the codec... there is few things the app can do.</p>

<p>Besides you talk about the fact you use pbxes.org as gateway to another sip provider. Did you try to directly connection to the sip provider without using pbxes.org? I know that sipdroid (developped by pbxes.org) usually advise to use pbxes.org, but that's not necessary, SIP is a standard and a sip client is able to connect a sip provider without using pbxes.org.</p>

<p>(However pbxes.org provides other cool features, so maybe you did this choice being aware about that pbxes.org is not required ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I started using pbxes.org a couple of years ago as my sip provider doesn't (or didn't) support logging in with different clients simultaneously. At home I'm connected using a Fritz!box with which I never had any problems with quality or had to manually change codecs (with any of the 4 sip provider I've been using). But I definitively prefer to use just one phone and send my desktop phone to retirement, unfortunately with Symbian and N900 solutions sip has never been as easy and of constant quality as with the Fritz!box, now I hope I get this working with CSipSimple.</p>

<p>Now having a test call where the caller doesn't hear me, it says:</p>

<h1>0 PCMA @8KHz, sendrecv, peer=88.198.69.250:40472</h1>

<p>The caller hears nothing at all and I hear the caller perfectly.</p></markdown-widget>
