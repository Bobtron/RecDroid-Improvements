1. Place a call. Phone vibrates. Vibrator indicator comes on on notification area
2. When haning up. Phone vibrates. Vibrator indicator comes off.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
I would expect the vibrator not to fire up. Instead it turns on briefly and randomly sometimes.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
nightly r1447 although this behaviour has been going on forever.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>

<p>"In order to avoid your ear to explode if there is an incoming GSM call, I put the ringer mode to silent (that's the mean of the icon in the notification bar). When call will end, ringer state will be restored to previous value."</p>

<p>One issue is that my phone is configured to not vibrate when in silent mode, somehow CSipSimple ignores this and makes it vibrate when it goes into silent mode.</p>

<p>Then while I understand the intent here, there should be a better way to do this. In most of the phones I've had, CSipSimple causes the vibrator to be set off every time it switches to or from 'silent state' and sometimes I get funky results with the vibrator going crazy for a few seconds. It can be very annoying.</p></markdown-widget>

<li>set phone to silent</li>

<p>You end up in some wierd state of 'silent' and if you do try to answer the mobile call it sits there vibrating away whilst you're trying to have a conversation.</p>

<p>I would rather it was entirely silent than vibrated every time it does something. Ideally of course it would make a quiet tone over the audio so you know there is another call, but.. :)</p></markdown-widget>

It will be produced in tonight build.
I've also fixed something else with vibrator remaining on after a failing call in recent nightlies.</p>

<p>Now, about the root issue, there is probably something I could do to make thing a little bit better in case your phone is already in "silent mode".
In fact, some previous versions of the app was putting phone in silent mode only (without modifying vibrator mode), and then was asked to use vibrator in these case (to still be informed of incoming calls). So I added it.
But I didn't thought about people already having phone in silent mode (only about people having phone in normal ringer mode).</p>

<p>So, what I could do to improve things a little bit is to not touch vibrator if phone was already in silent mode when the sip call becomes up. Since in this case, the phone was already in silent mode, it's affordable to not notify user about incoming gsm call.
What do you think?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>When you are in a call and you get another, a gentle sound notification is heard on speaker. Then you look onto the screen and decide if to switch, merge, hangup... This happens even if the vibrator is on for the phone, just tried it with the stock phone app of my phone.</p>

<p>So IMHO you should stop playing/touching the vibrator in all cases, and simply notify the user with some sound in the ongoing outbound audio.</p></markdown-widget>

But keep in mind I do this project on my free time, and have very limited time to develop (all the more so as I spend a lot of time for support and I'm alone with that).</p>

<p>So you're right in ideal case, I should add a notification to audio sip stream and turn phone to silent mode. (this is still necessary). </p>

<p>But that is another issue, and it has to be done cleanly as an enhancement with enough time to be sure it doesn't bring any regression.</p>

<p>About the possibility to merge/switch/hangup UI that's &lt;&gt; not possible for a sip application (that is third party) to deal with the call management of gsm. That's for obvious security reason. 
However, not all manufacturer make it safe, and there is private APIs (hacks) that could be used, but as a mainstream application it's unsafe to rely on these breachs ;).
So the only thing I can do is leave the stock gsm application present its view.</p></markdown-widget>
