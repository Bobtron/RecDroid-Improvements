1. Make call.  Normal audio through headset.
2. Hit speaker button.  Turns green as if it is on.
3. Audio remains with the headset, doesn't switch to speaker.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Wanted to use speaker for audio.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Latest ginger nightly (r1006).  Android 2.3.4.  Have been testing the ginger nightlies for a bit now, and they are much better on the Droid 3 (the trunk builds generally don't give me audio at all regardless of routing settings).  The ginger builds have behaved very well except for the speaker issue.  Motorola seems to have excluded the native Android SIP dialer, so maybe they fiddled with something else.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
For what it's worth, the speaker works fine for the tones when dialing on the keypad (the internal CSipSimple keypad).  I've tried the various audio routing options and combinations to no effect, though they (and most problem reports) seem to generally refer to trying to get the sound off of the speaker, where I'm trying the opposite.  Of course, of the two problems, having it only through the headset is probably the better of the two.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, very interesting point. Normally both trunk and ginger uses the same way to setup the audio routing. So interesting point that motorola have a different behavior on each build. 
Hopefully they started to plug the OpenSL layer to lower audio stack layers. Would be a great thing.</p>

<p>However, if they did, the problem is that they have probably not yet connect the higher api to actions in the lower api. 
As consequence anything I do using the android java api to route audio is probably without effects on the OpenSL connection with audio driver.</p>

<p>To have this working I have to refactor the way I handle audio glue with android OS. That's a little bit tricky and I postponed that to the time one manufacturer start to really implement the OpenSL-ES api. But now that droid3 seems to have something started :)... I should take the point.</p>

<p>For info, if they really do what I suspect they do, it is a really good news cause it means that audio latency will be really low on this devices compared to all other android devices on which sip applications (even the stock sip application) have to use the android higher (and slower) api. If they decided to do that, it would also explain why they don't have yet the stock sip application : this one also use the android api instead of the OpenSL-ES api.
AFAIK, for now, there is only csipsimple gingerbread build and webRTC that implements the OpenSL-ES api. But I guess (would be logic), that next version of the stock sip application will also use opensl-es.</p></markdown-widget>

Technically I think the settings are still set for the Java api (and WebRTC turned off) so I'm guessing the autodetection is overriding some of those settings?</p>

<p>One thing I did notice is that in test calls to the same number (comparing cell network and voip), the speaker with csipsimple was very quiet.  I needed to bump the speaker amplification to the max of 10 to get reasonably close to the regular (non-voip) speaker volume range, and even then it wasn't quite as high.  The same sort of difference didn't exist with the regular headset output to the same number.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is the first time csipsimple worked with my speaker so I have nothing to compare against it may be a completely unrelated issue, but just thought I'd mention it.</p>

<p>The speaker amplification is probably a side effect of these workarounds. Maybe you should try to tweak things to see if you can find a better set of options for droid3. As I don't own one, the auto settings are based on users feedback, but maybe the current state is not perfect in all cases. So you could try other combinations to see how it goes.
If you changed too many things and want to reset settings, you can use the "reset" option in menu of the first setting screen (where there is all sections).</p>

<p>Don't hesitate to give me feedback if you find something, so that I can integrate that to auto-detected settings :) Thanks.</p></markdown-widget>
