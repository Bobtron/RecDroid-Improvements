Clear audio, instead choppy audio</p>

It's probably not the best codec in term of CPU usage. What you could try is to change the audio channel frequency I guess that's already to 16kHz (which is probably the best value for g722, but you could try another value).</p></markdown-widget>

Well I guess there is still something to optimize in pjsip for those codecs. I sometimes get something strange with iLBC when trying to call a server at the other side of the world (what is strange is that it's always on exactly one half of the tests). Maybe some DSP on some server made things strange that are not properly handled by pjsip. 
In fact, CSipSimple rely on pjsip for everything related to SIP protocol and codecs. It's a good sip stack used in many applications on pc, mac, symbian, windows mobile, psp, iphone... etc. 
I try to modify the less thing as possible in their code (for maintainability, and also because they are really much better than me on SIP protocol ;) ).
But they are still developing the library and I keep up to date my branch with their dev trunk. So, maybe if they fix something with these heavy codec, CSipSimple will take advantage of these fixes. (Or possibly its something in my audio driver... but as most of the time it's flawlessly functional, not sure it's the point).</p></markdown-widget>

Also g722 use a lot of bandwidth (HD codec), so you should use it only on wifi networks. Also, what is the device you are using? 
Android audio drivers may differ from one device to another. 
It could also be due to the PSP behavior when screen goes off.</p>

<p>See the FAQ wiki page about all these points.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>FRITZ!Box is a SoHo router with a built-in SIP registrar and also works as a WiFi hotspot. So, the SIP connection is via WiFi and actually never enters the Internet, which should give sufficient bandwidth. I guess STUN is not relevant in this scenario (no NAT is involved). The debug feature of the FRITZ!Box router also shows no loss of audio packets. PSP should also not be an issue as the screen remains dimmed (but not off) all the time. Other codecs such as iLBC work without issues.</p>

<p>The device I am using is an HTC Desire (with a Gingerbread ROM, though).</p>

<p>Is there anything I could do to debug the issue further?</p></markdown-widget>
