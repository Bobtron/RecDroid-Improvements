<p>The problem with the call that drop is very interesting. Apparently logs you sends are not showing the problem (I see in logs that there is an answer from csipsimple).
If easy to reproduce, could you start log recording, reproduce the problem that leads to the screenshot and just after send me logs. (the logs are automatically limited by android so I only get latests actions).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance :)</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi</p>

<p>Thanks for the logs and the explanation. I misunderstood first the problem.</p>

<p>In fact the problem starts from the answer of the application. It sends a 200 OK to the invite but never get any reply (ACK) from the server. So it never arrives to the confirmed state.</p>

<p>In this case the call will automatically ends after 30 sec of retry. 
Normally in this case it should behaves slightly differently than your description (it's what I observe in logs too)-- on the device that receive the call --. 
The interface should display "Connecting…" in the blue line. Normally there is also the button to terminate the call.
In your logs I see that when you terminate the call the server reply with "481 Call leg/transaction does not exist" and the call ends immediately.</p>

<p>However possible that if your server on the middle actually doesn't takes a role of sip proxy the device that initiate the call is in the state you describe.</p>

<p>Usually this case happens when the SIP server is not a sip proxy (or manage proxying a weird way). If I don't mistake FreePBX is based on Asterisk which is not really a SIP proxy (it's more a gateway to pstn network).
As your are on your LAN a SIP proxy is probably not mandatory in your architecture, so it could be fine. However, by default csipsimple when you configure server with the basic wizard consider that as both registrar and proxy (because in mainstream user case and sip provider case there is very often a real sip proxy in front of the topology).
So you should try to disable in csipsimple account configuration the sip proxy. To do so, switch your account to expert wizard mode (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/ExpertSettingMode?wl=en#Account_settings">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/ExpertSettingMode?wl=en#Account_settings</a> ) and edit the "Proxy" field and remove contents of it (set it blank). Do that on both devices (caller and callee).</p>

<p>If it doesn't help and if you have an hand on the sip server it would be very interesting to have logs of the server and/or a tcpdump trace (~# sudo tcpdump -s 1500 -w outfile.pcap). It would confirm that the sip server receive correctly sip packets from the client and what/where it replies if it replies.</p></markdown-widget>

Also, just to be sure,  what I describe in comment #8 is what you observe? The screenshot is on caller side?
You are calling between two csipsimple? Or you are calling between csipsimple and something else on the server?</p>

<p>BTW, could be interesting to test a call to an auto-attendant on the sip server. There is maybe a voice mail server you can test?</p></markdown-widget>
