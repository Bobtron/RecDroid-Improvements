1. Make a SIP call from CSS
2. Answer the call by a SIP client
3. Watch for the second round of INVITE messages immediately after the call is answered</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expected: There is no second round of INVITE messages triggered by CSS
Instead: CSS triggers unnecessary round of INVITE messages, confirming the same call</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
r1064 (and earlier versions too), Android 2.1 </p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I'm watching this problem looking at log generated by FreeSWITCH (UAS). Calls are made by CSS via UAS (FS) to another SIP client (UAC).</p>

<p>Making a a call, CSS sends initial INVITE message. After the call is answered by UAC, CSS gets "OK/INVITE" message (as expected). But then suddenly it sends the same INVITE message again, causing the new round of INVITE messages:
1. CSS - UAS: INVITE
2. UAS - CSS: Trying
3. UAS - UAC: INVITE
4. UAC - UAS: OK/INVITE
5. UAS - UAC: ACK
6. UAS - CSS: OK/INVITE</p>

<p>How to avoid unnecessary second round of messages actually repeating the initial call?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I've installed the latest build r1094 and it still exhibit that weird problem. I watch SIP packets with FreeSWITCH: CSS makes a call. Other UAC accepts the call and, when CSS gets OK for its initial INVITE request, it sends to FreeSWITCH the very same INVITE message again. The second round of all messages is fast and don't disrupt the already established new call, but it creates completely unnecessary traffic between all parties (CSS, FreeSWITCH and remote UAC)... </p>

CSS sends initial set of supported codecs. After negotiation with SIP server and remote UAC it gets OK/INVITE message with reduced subset of codecs, that both ends (CSS and remote UAC) do support. Then it picks up the first codec from the list and starts the second round of negotiation, now providing only one codec. Of cause the second round succeeds, because the codec was already approved by both parties in the initial round...</p>

<p>Now the logical question arises - why CSS needs the second round of codec negotiation?
The codec to use is already picked up by CSS from the <em>approved</em> list of codecs, that both parties can use. CSS should just start immediately using it... The second round is completely pointless and unnecessary. Can we get rid of that?</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well, actually that's not really relevant of csipsimple but rather of pjsip (the sip stack used by csipsimple).
So if a fix has to be done, it should be done on the sip stack, and it is unfortunately not relevant of csipsimple project. Sometimes I do some hack on the sip stack, but this point would imply a hudge refactoring.</p>

<p>I can tell you what I understood from my readings on pjsip project about this issue. Cause it is actually really annoying when the sip server ignores (because buggy) the re-invite / update and keep using one random entry on the codec list instead of the one choosen by pjsip.</p>

<p>First, the tickets on pjsip project that talk about codec lock process :
<a href="http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/476">http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/476</a>
(and maybe this one too ) : <a href="http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/1242">http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/1242</a></p>

<p>Well, the point is that pjsip does not support to receive multiple codecs at a time. I guess that the first reason why that they didn't planned to have this feature by their first design. I think that another reason is that support multiple codec at the same time mean mounting different the codecs immplementation at the same time which increase memory footiprint of the stack, and pjsip guys really take care about using as less memory as possible. However I would have expected at least an option to choose... but there's no option for now in pjsip :(. The only way csipsimple can force pjsip to avoid this scenario is to select only one valid codec from the first SDP.</p>

<p>pjsip guys knows about this problem but for now that's not a high priority on their side cause the lock codec process is completely RFC compliant. 
So if you have other arguments to ask them to support multiple codecs at a time you can make pressure on pjsip mailing list. The only argument I had was about buggy sip server, but that's not really an argument... SIP servers must handle correctly the update/re-invite with codec locked. Network usage could be an argument, but not sure that's really significant.
On CSipSimple side, it is not a good idea to make a local fix : first reason is that it will take me a lot of time to dive into pjsip media process, second reason is that it will not become easy to maintain, and last reason is that by fixing that on pjsip level, it will not only benefit csipsimple but all sip client based on pjsip (those on windows, linux, symbian, iphone, and the others on android, even the closed source one like 3cx).</p>

<p>So, I tag the issue as WontFix, cause I will not fix that in csipsimple. Obviously if it is fixed in pjsip, it will automatically be fixed in csipsimple too.</p></markdown-widget>

we'll have to live with it, until it's fixed in pjsip. I think they
have to do a better job with supporting more then one codec per call

to avoid the second round on INVITE messages and I'm sure that it
finally will be implemented.
