                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Make a call to an echo server.
2. Talk in short words, and in longer sencences.
3. Listen the change of level and quality of returned voice.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Level and quality of the sound should be constant over time.
Instedad, the first half-second of speech is overmodulated to the level of unintelligibility. As you speek constantly, the level becomes lower and the speech undestandable. After a pause, sound becomes overmodulated again.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
I first noticed it in .12-26 I think, after I skipped several previous versions. The problem persists as of .12-32. I have VAD on, echo cancellation on. Android 2.2 on HTC Desire. Codec in use is Speex 8k.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I am sure that things did change. The sound was all right sometime about version .12-19, then I was on vacation, and when I returned and upgraded to .12-26 I noticed this problem (I did not make any other changes). The problem is bad enough for the people to whom I speak to start complaining.</p></markdown-widget>

I reverted the part intended for GalaxyS (and all alsa based implementation).
Let me know whether better. If no, it's probably audio focus feature as stated by egrosser and I'll then try to disable that / or change the way it's done.</p>

<p>Another information that could be interesting to me is what you get using the (i)nformation button on the in call screen.
You can see here : the codec actually in use (can be different from the top of your priority list) since other part can ask to use another supported codec by CSipSimple. Btw, CSipSimple support a lot of codec now (that was not all supported in -12 from the market). If your callee choose a codec that consume a lot of cpu on your device, it can has an impact on sound quality. 
You'll also be able to see packet loss %age. Could be interesting to be able to say if network has something to do with your problem.</p>

<p>@egcrosser : if it's the solution... it's really annoying... I've to divert the way packets are get from the mic... The worse thing is that there is no sure way to determine what method I have to use with a given device...
I'll make another try with the galaxyS method but with some improvements.</p></markdown-widget>

Alsa implementation requires we read on the micro buffer not faster than the frame rate of the micro stream. Else it fill the missing content with empty datas. Other devices usually wait before returning complete frame.
So in other device I just need the loop to read, but with galaxy S, I have sometime to wait before read. Sounds it has a side effect on some other devices. Actually on my Nexus One I didn't observed any sound variation but possible that for your Desire it has an impact.
For now, I didn't really optimized neither had a real though about my implementation. </p></markdown-widget>

When log are recording, establish a call and about 5 seconds after end the call. In order to let me collect establishment and end of the call.
