<p>Just an important point, I don't know how your account is configured, but pbxes.org is in most case not needed if you have another SIP provider. Sipdroid is linked to the company that provide pbxes.org and so all their tutorials link pbxes.org, but SIP is not available only with pbxes.org and in most case they explain how to use pbxes.org as a SIP proxy and make trunk with another SIP account.
But CSipSimple can works directly with the other SIP account.</p>

<p>However, I should probably add a pbxes.org wizard with labels that match the pbxes.org interface. Maybe it can helps.</p>

<p>@jeralbsib : is pbxes.org your only sip provider or did you use it with a trunk added? If in your first post, by pbxes you mean your own pbx or another provider, let me know the configuration you use on any sip softphone (or android app) and I'll try to convert it into how to fill either basic or expert account according to the complexity of the configuration you need.</p>

<p>@runnersame : your tutorial is really nice, but there is a little confusion I think about what is an Asterisk server : sip2sip.info sip server is also an Asterisk server. 
Asterisk is just a sip server, as Openser, or others (it's like if you compare apache &amp; lighttpd etc). The difference can be the features provided by your provider, but not the fact it is an Asterisk or not. Some sip server can be media gateways, sip proxy, provide stun...</p>

<p>As you tested and reported to me, sip2sip account can be directly configured. We have to find out why in certain condition it automatically hangup but I'll send you a mail today if I can get some time to.</p>

<p>Btw, there is a big lack of documentation for now, but as the project is still in <em>alpha</em> interface will change a lot ! So I fear that docs you'll write right now will be outdated for the beta. However, if you are interested in writing piece of docs, I can open you the right on the wiki of this website. </p></markdown-widget>

<p>If you need the settings I am using at my service providers, please let me know.  I would be happy to add documentation to the project, but I am still new to sip/pbx/voip.  I am NOT a programmer or coder, just a knowledgeable user (I used to do desktop support for a living for 5 years).  Also, I have never edited a wiki before, so perhaps I can submit a guide once it is all sorted out?  Let me know!
Cheers!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>This is required if you want the cheapest services for different things, or if you live in the Netherlands where by law your landline/voip MUST be registered to an address.  My main provider 12voip is RIDICULOUSLY low priced for outgoing calls, but because of this stupid law here in the Netherlands, they are unable to offer an inbound line to me.  So after looking around, I found mydivert.com, and they do inbound lines in the Netherlands for 4.00 Euro a month.</p>

<p>@r3gis.3R, first of all, I am not a SIP professional.  I have experience in setting up a Asterisk server and makes it working.  As far as I know, h is an IP PBX which deals with trunks (SIP providers) and do something further for the incoming and outgoing calls.  May be SIP providers just provide a number or address for using the VoIP features.  Asterisk will take care of the others, such as handling the calling time, extensions, voice recording and much more.</p>

<p>In addition, my Linksys SPA941 cannot work without Asterisk server in my initial test.</p>

<p>I think that I will free and happy to write document for CSipSimple.  I have tested almost all the apps in the Market and find that CSipSimple suits my taste.  The interface is quiet user-friendly and easy to understand.  Please allow me to access wiki page if you agreed.</p>

<p>So far, I do not know how to capture the screen from my Nexus One, the document that I write will be in text only.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, I will be free to be a tester too.  I have 2 Nexus One, Asterisk server and 2 networks with or without UTM, bluetooth earpieces, and 2 GSM providers.</p></markdown-widget>

But my goal is not to provide something for a specific provider. I want to let user the choice. (Freedom is a matter of choice ;) ). Besides in many configuration pbxes.org is not really necessary. In fact, in France 2 out of 3 internet access provider provide to their user a free SIP account linked to the phone account. And so it provide an incoming and outgoing sip number associated to a pstn number. And in that case, we don't need pbxes.org... But all tutorials with sipdroid made to explain how to configure our accouts starts by "create a account on pbxes.org" .... while it's absolutely useless in our case. That's the reason why I try to learn people on android that pbxes.org is not an absolute need to use voip. That said, if you use pbxes.org for the feature they provide and that's a conscientious choice that's fine. My point is just to warn you about that. There is too many field in informatics where users doesn't take their own conscientious choice (see the success of the iphone...).</p>

<p>@jeralsib : I'll add a pbxes.org wizard today. It will make thing easier and take the same labels that the one presents on pbxes.org website (I'll try to find where are my pbxes.org credentials to test it properly ;) )</p></markdown-widget>

PBX services such as PBXes.org serve to no purpose as long as you use one line and have no need for extensions. I if understand you right though, as soon as you are permanently registered to two or more sip providers on csipsimple, grouping them to a PBX service and register PBX service on csipsimple would make sense in terms of battery consumption!
BTW I tried to find other free PBX services, but so far only PBXes.org registers to the sip provider for free (voxalot does this for a subscription). I don't like having my calls go through a german server anyway, but either put up with it or register my accounts directly to csipsimple and use a little more battery...</p></markdown-widget>

<p>To install an apk that is not on the market download a file explorer for android like EStrongs file explorer.</p>

<p>Than remove your sdcard from the phone and put it into a computer somehow.</p>

<p>copy the APK to the sdcard and reinsert it into the phone</p>

<p>Use Estrongs file exporer to navigate to the APK, click it, and it will install.</p>

<p>Answer to question number 2, how do you set up pbxes.org:</p>

<p>In the new and MUCH improved setup wizard (You guys ROCK!!!!) go to new international account and enter the following for the account setup:</p>

<p>account:  me-100  (where me is your user name, and the -100 is your extension)
Password:  your password for pbxes.org.</p>

<p>And THAT is it...  The old guide is no longer needed, and you can close this issue!</p></markdown-widget>

Then for login and password I don't know exactly what is provided by MagicJack. You should maybe ask on this forum :
<a href="http://www.magicjacksupport.com/beta-testing-android-solution-csipsimple-w-built-in-mjmd5-t9743-15.html">http://www.magicjacksupport.com/beta-testing-android-solution-csipsimple-w-built-in-mjmd5-t9743-15.html</a>
The guys on this forum asked me and helped me to test and implement a build in solution in csipsimple that allow to use magicjack authentication method.</p>

<p>According to what they ask me to write username is something like Exxxxx01 and password should be SIP password (probably something different from your user password...)
I guess that on the forum they'll be able to help you more than I could. But if that's something not linked to your credentials, ask me again (you can send me a private mail if you want).</p></markdown-widget>
