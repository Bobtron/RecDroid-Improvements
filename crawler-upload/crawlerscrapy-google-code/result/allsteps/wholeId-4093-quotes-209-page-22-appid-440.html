<p>The only way I can reproduce this issue is when registering with XNET in New Zealand. Registration is successful, but it appears that addresses of the form "who@where:5060;ob" cannot be resolved when the xnet proxy attempts to connect to my phone for incoming calls.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>Version 0.00-16 r410. Running on a Google/Huawai Ideos with Android 2.2.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>It seems the ";ob" extension has only appeared in a draft RFC (tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sip-outbound) and not in any standards-track RFC. There should perhaps be a flag or a switch to turn on/off non-standard options?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>However, you should report the bug to your sip provider too. I think that they will be interested in it. Cause even if they do not support the option they should not misbehaves regarding extensions, it should just ignore it... and I think that is in RFCs.</p>

<p>By default I'll keep PJSUA_REG_USE_OUTBOUND_PROXY + PJSUA_REG_USE_ACC_PROXY option cause if supported in mobile environment, outbound proxy provide a lot of advantage. On most sip server even if ob is not supported the sip server just ignore it and there is no problem with that.</p>

<p>As consequence, if XNET misbehaves with that option, what I could do (and what I do usually in such case when sip server need some legacy option), is to create a wizard for it that automatically set this new option to the correct value.</p>

<p>So, in the same time I'll add the option in expert account wizard for removing ob support, a good idea would be to create a wizard for XNET to ease things for XNET users. 
To do so, if possible, could you send me a 48x48 px icon for XNET (if not I'll search on the web), and most important (that's more hard to find usually), the default configuration that I should hard code for XNET (sip registrar, domain, if username and auth name are different etc).</p>

<p>If you can get support from XNET and ask them to fix their server to ignore the unsupported extension, let me know, I'll remove the legacy option (not the wizard ;), if you use it I guess other users too, so worth to have the wizard anyway )</p></markdown-widget>
