<p>What do you mean by "partially incorrect"? Is there some of the number that are correctly read?</p>

<p>In fact, in case of DTMF generated over analogic tone generation, if only some of the digits are not properly detected by the other side, it could be explained by some loss of quality in the audio stream. 
So it could be interesting to know :
 * How your sip provider support DTMF tones? (analogic generation, RTP, or SIP INFO -- in the two latest case, it's robust to audio quality loss)
 * In case of analogic generation :
  - Is the codec in use while in call is PCMU/PCMA ? -- it's a codec that should not loss audio or compress, which is good to transmit DTMF codes, but it consume a lot of bandwidth. On other side, other codecs are much more performant in terms of bandwidth but as compress to transmit voice only, it may loss high frequency of DTMF and the other side may be completely loss.
   - Does the network allows to pass enough bandwidth for PCMU/PCMA? 64kbit/s is very high for mobile data network or slow networks. In case of mobile network, depending of numbers of people connected at the same time on the antenna, the bandwidth can be reduced. In this case this could be critical point.</p>

<p>Anyway, it could be very interesting to check if your sip provider support SIP info or RTP payload. This is way more robust than analogic tone generation. 
By default in media settings, you'll find something about DTMF option. By default it's Auto (this means that it will first try to use RTP payloads if supported by remote side and fallback to analogic generation if not supported). You can try to force RTP or SIP INFO and see how it goes.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks Regis.  My sip provider is pbxes.org.  I am not sure I can find out
how they handle DTMF--I will try.  Partially incorrect: I enter a number,
e.g. 646-3416665 and the machine says e.g. 646-6630016.  I see your point
about loss of quality.  I was sitting next to my router, and I normally
have a great quality line.  I just checked the codec and it says PCMU/8kHz.
 I did try all possibilities (automatic, in band, RTP, and SIP INFO)--no
difference.  By the way, could you just call T-mobile's number
(18003851977) yourself, enter an arbitrary 10-digit US number, and say
whether it works well for you?  If so, I will know to troubleshoot
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed, which may or may not be relevant.  During DTMF
input, the screen sometimes goes off, then comes back on again after a
second or so.  It looks like the finger using the keypad triggers the
proximity sensor.  It may be that the sensor is activated so easily that it
interferes with the keypad input perhaps even when the trigger input from
my finger is not long enough to actually switch the screen off.  Just a
thought.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, normally pbxes.org should support all options. So you can leave the option to automatic.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't try to call the t-mobile number, I'm in france ;). But other pure sip provider I can test (voipms) that have the same feature to tell the dtmf number and it works well.</p>

<p>How does your pbxes.org gateway to landline network? Is there another provider between? Maybe things are fine between client and pbxes.org but goes wrong after. I say that because you don't observe any different while trying inband/RTP or SIP INFO. Normally if was something between csipsimple and first hop should result in very different result. One should not work at all or produce worse result in case of in band generation. Here seems that pbxes.org or another gateway transform everything in the middle to make things comprehensible on the other side. Basically on the landline network everything is done using in band generation (since no RTP nor SIP info).</p>

<p>About the proximity sensor, weird. It could be the finger indeed. Normally if the phone is detected in horizontal position the proximity sensor should be disabled however. (it's only enabled in vertical position). 
Anyway, if you see the button of the dtmf dialpad becoming blue it's take into account by the app (and then, even if the screen turns off, it should not impact how the dtmf code is sent).</p></markdown-widget>
