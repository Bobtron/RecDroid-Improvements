1. Requires an account with pbxes.org 
2. Use the basic account wizard in CSipSimple to access pbxes.org
3. Change the settings to use TCP
4. Attempt to register, status only says "In progress"</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
A successfull registration enabling incomming and outgoing calls to be made.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
0.00-11 on Nexus One (with Android 2.2)</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I usually use a setup using TCP with pbxes.org in order to consume battery. This works in Sipdroid but I have not managed to register CSipSimple with pbxes.org using TCP. With UDP it works fine in CSipSimple.</p></markdown-widget>

I didn't notice it but something has to be added in the registration uri to use TCP transport. And previously pjsip stack doesn't care about it if only TCP transport was created, that's the reason why I though my management of the transport was already good.</p>

<p>Btw, if you want to try it with your current version, there is a workaround : 
you add your account as an expert account and as "Registration URI" you add ";transport=tcp" at the end of the line.
For example :
"sip:pbxes.com;transport=tcp"</p>

<p>I'll try to find a smart way to add this parameter to registration uri automatically if needed choosen in global preferences. </p></markdown-widget>

<p>In my case this whould be the preffered solution as I could register a signaling TCP connection for incomming calls (through PBXes account) and when making outbound calls I could use UDP (through my provider).</p>

<p>Whould it be possible to have another network transport option for "UDP and TCP" which whould add both a UDP and a TCP transport during initialization? I am assuming (without having looked) that this is how the pjsua application does this.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>This however requires that the Keep-Alive period for TCP can be changed to a much higher value then the default used by pjsip (I think the default for pjsip is set to 90 seconds). If the Sipdroid wiki page mentioned in above post is correct then changing this Keep-Alive interval to say 3600 seconds should mean much less power consumption for the phone in standby mode.</p>

It seems that PBXes does not respond correctly with the transport=tcp in the contact which makes pjsip attempt to send BYE using UDP instead. I belive this is incorrect behaviour on the part of PBXes.</p>

<p>I tested using sipsorcery instead which responds correctly. I then ran into another problem which is when registering via TCP the NAT trick in pjsip does not function as expected. During registration it detects the external ip:port from the rport as expected but when it attempts the reregister it keeps using the internal ip anyway and so it keeps looping forever during the registration process. To get around this I recompiled pjsip without the freephonie hack and then it works :-)</p>

<p>I also did a quick hack to add 2 transports at once (one UDP and one TCP) and that seems to work very well, enabling me to activate both UDP and TCP at once in the accounts using the advanced wizard.</p></markdown-widget>

So i'll remove freephonie hack from next builds. Seems to be useless in most cases even with freephonie on production builds.</p>

<p>Ok for the 2 transports, great news. I'll try to implement something soon. Or if you want to contribute on this subject, I can grant you an access on the svn.
On my side, what I've planned to implement is :
 * One global settings choose the default transport TCP or UDP to use (if not specified in the wizard).
 * Configuration for TCP (port) and configuration for UDP (port).
 * Give access in expert and advanced mode (to be done) to an additional option that allow to choose between tcp and udp.</p>

<p>When sip stack is started if any account with tcp is present and active, it starts tcp (and same thing with udp).
Finally, an evolution could be to allow user to add manually transports and then choose one of these transports in the expert wizard. But in a first time it is a little bit too complicated I think.</p>

<p>What do you think about such an implementation?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Since not all providers support TCP (most probably don't actually) it might be enough to leave this up to the respective wizard. In expert mote it can be used as it currently is with adding the parameter which seems to be standard in sip. Network configuration can be extended with a "Enable TCP" and an "Enable UDP" checkbox. And if enabled a port can then be choosen below. Default setting can then be to enable both with port 5060.</p>

<p>CSipSimple also needs to send the user agent field when registering. I think all that is needed is to set a user agent string in the config (ie something like "CSipSimple" in cfg.user_agent). Seems sipsorcery does not grant the requested re-registration value otherwise.</p></markdown-widget>

No additional REGISTER traffic at all, and the account is still stuck at Registering. Finally going into Network settings, turning off BOTH TCP and UDP, back to phone.

<p>From Comment 27: "You are probably right that both UDP and TCP transports should be enabled by default as for most cases this should never be changed."</p>

<p>May I just remove the UDP and TCP preferences (keep the UDP Port and TCP Port!), and the if() logic during sip startup, and ALWAYS create both transports? Can you think of a reason one or the other transport would need to be disabled globally (for all accounts)?</p>

<p>I would like to remove them, as it is a confusing point between those prefs and the new Use TCP pref in the account. If the global ones (network prefs) must stay, then I must find a way to handle the situation where the account selection (TCP/UDP) is not enabled in network prefs. I dislike the idea of toast popups for such things.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For basic account I think there should be the option to choose TCP/UDP with UDP being default.</p>

<p>Leave the transport settings as they are except also enable TCP by default. The pjsip reference application pjsua has options to specify "no-tcp" and "no-udp" so I think we should assume there are reasons to keep this setting. I also don't think you have to add any check when setting the transport parameter in the wizard. If someone explicitly disables TCP we have to assume they know that an account using TCP will not register.</p></markdown-widget>

I think we should add an account wizard "Advanced" that allow to activate tcp. I'd like Basic wizard to be a really simple way for mainstream users to quickly add an account. Then if they want to, they will be able to transform the Basic wizard into the Advanced one and activate TCP. Besides, I hope that we will create enough wizards for each provider and activate automatically tcp for providers that support it.</p>

<p>Bob, as you added a field in the database, you should implement "public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) " from DBAdapter. Take a look on how I did things for KA_INTERVAL field. Should be the same way to update the db for users how have already CSipSimple installed and want to keep their account configuration (this applies to the market version).</p>

<p>For the last point (transport). What about my suggestion? Activate tcp only if one of the active account has transport=tcp or tcp activated in database? And do the same for udp? If this can be automatically detected, there is no reason to ask the user to choose. Isn't it?</p></markdown-widget>

So you're right if server can decide to choose tcp, we must enable it by default.</p>

<p>It could be a good idea to make tests with / without the transport enabled (without any account registered) to know what is the impact on battery usage of a extra transport.
Code has to be modified to allow this test since if there is no account remote pjsip is shut down - maybe should we allow "local" accounts? -
Theses tests could be provide as a wiki documentation to explain what parameter can be modified to reduce battery usage (or set as default parameters according accounts and/or device).</p>

<p>I'm looking for something to trace exactly the battery usage with more precision than the android tool (which seems to not take into account native library - or if yes... it means that csipsimple take about 3% of the battery after a full day of use..... I don't think so....).
Any idea?</p>

<p>P.S. : for advanced, we can also add sip proxy field, display name (optional) and authentication name (optional - leave blank will reuse the username field).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Maybe you should open a new issue or ask on the user mailing list if you have an issue.
About, the registration time it does not depends on the transport kind at all. So it's in the expert wizard account mode. If you mean the keep alive time, it's in global settings (network) also in expert setting mode. (See the ExpertSettingMode wiki page).
In nightly build there is also the option for tcp keep alive (and the market version contains the option for udp only).</p>

<p>Then if you have a more detailed description you can open a new issue. Please take care to specify your sip provider. Not all sip providers does actually support correctly TCP. In this case it's not the client application to blame but your sip provider ;)</p></markdown-widget>
