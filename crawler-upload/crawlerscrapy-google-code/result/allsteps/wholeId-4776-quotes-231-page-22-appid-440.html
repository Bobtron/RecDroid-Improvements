1. Download the application on the market.
2. Download additionnal components using the application.
3. Use the "Next" button when it's done.</p>

<p>-&gt; What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The program should work. It crashes instead (no forceclose, nothing at all).</p>

<p>-&gt; What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
I'm using The Robot (similar to Sciphone N19) from Chinavasion, Android 1.5.</p>

You can try to run the new version.</p>

<p>I hope it will fix the problem for you (i'm not really confident in the way .so are
attached - as application/binary, I hope that android 1.5 email application consider
this type as a valid attachement for emails).</p>

<p>If it still doesn't work, i'll write an alternate solution on the wiki based on the
SDK ( 
adb pull /system/lib/libmedia.so .
adb pull /system/lib/libcutils.so .
adb pull /system/lib/libutils.so .
).</p>

<p>For the cpu, I think that, since it's ARM architecture, it will work once I will
re-build for your phone media libs.
Besides, I think that sipdroid is not compliant with android 1.5, my app should be (I
have tested it with the phone of a collegue under android 1.5). Unfortunately from a
SDK point of view make an app compatible with android 1.5 is not really trivial and
there is a big gap between 1.5 and 1.6. So I guess that sipdroid devs had decided to
not support this sdk. But I think that there is still a lot of user that are using
1.5, so I'll try to support it as long as it will be possible.</p>

<p>I attached a version of the application (with a bundled native lib compiled for your

<p>If everything is ok, the application should start without trying to download anything
and without crashing. If it redirects you to the wiki page, your guess was right,
there is an issue with the CPU version, and I fear that it will be really difficult
to support this kind of device.</p>

<p>As you suspected, it's probably a problem with armv4.
I've just found a webpage which deals with this kind of issue
(<a href="http://benno.id.au/blog/2008/10/27/android-on-armv4-take2">http://benno.id.au/blog/2008/10/27/android-on-armv4-take2</a>). (There is also other
references that announces that armv4 is unfortunately not supported by NDK (native
developpement toolkit). :(</p>

<p>So i'll try to follow instructions given by benno on his website. It may take some
times because I've to modify the NDK once again to merge benno's changes and my changes.
It will take me time. So stay tuned, but i'll not submit you a fix until several weeks.
Once again, many many thanks for all the time you spent testing the app and I hope
that my next try will be the good one :).</p></markdown-widget>

It fails really early when it calls the native lib but the stack trace attached
explains me why. There is still things I have to modify on the NDK to get it work
with armv4 (re-build the toolchain for armv4) (at least for armv4 since it appears to
be different from armv4T - so for the robot it's still worth to try maybe the failure
doesn't appear so quickly that it appears on the Neo Freerunner).</p>

<p>I'll also try to see if it couldn't be directly built using the openmoko android
portage source (it could be easier than use a ported NDK in a first time) (and I
guess this portage is open-sourced).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>However I went further in the tests. I tried 2 things.</p>

<p>The first time, I enabled Wifi and I was connected to my personal network. The app
launches, BUT it crashes many, many times, well, it never ends crashing every few
seconds. Those crashes don't bring home screen back, they just make the screen black
for a few seconds, the notifications bar remains visible though. If I'm fast and if I
get lucky, I can hit "Add account", then I'm being asked to choose between a few
wizards, however hitting one of those wizards does not work, it does nothing and the
next crash occurs quickly. I attached a (big) log named CSipSimpleWifi.txt for this.</p>

<p>Then, I tried disabling Wifi. SAME RESULT so I won't talk about this.</p>

<p>Then, the "true" second time, I rebooted the phone without enabling the Wifi. When
launching CSipSimple, I'm getting a little message saying I'm not connected to any
network ("The Robot" / "Sciphone N19" / TA1 doesn't have 3G and I don't need it, and
I didn't enable GPRS of course :] ), and I can hit "Add account" ; the app seems to
work. However, when I try to hit any wizard, the app FORCE CLOSES (and restarts). But
if I do nothing at all except launching the app, I'm getting no crash at all. I
attached a log named CSipSimpleNoWifi.txt for this.</p>

<p>Finally, I pulled by .so files as you asked, all is in the .zip file attached. :)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Henri (comment 11 on the above post), found a way to use NDK for armv4t ! He even succeed in building and running CSipSimple on a freerunner :D</p>

Will be fine for armv4*T* . I don't know if it will works form armv4 (I don't really know what are the difference between the two cpu). So for armv4 owners (sciphone) worth to try with this one.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>You can send me a direct mail about your problem with sound. I guess that's a problem with either the network or the configuration. But as it could also be a problem with audio layer worth to ensure there is not something wrong.
I know that on android Q8 a clone of sciphone there is something wrong with audio micro... so still some issues to check to ensure it's good.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well, for latency I guess that's due to the hardware limits - you could try to change the codecs to force PCMU/PCMA (known to consume less cpu than others). 
You could also try to change clockrate/frequency (change between 16kHz &amp; 8kHz : 8kHz will consume less CPU but increase latency, 16kHz latency will be twice lower but cpu will be more loaded)
It could also be due to the audio implementation of the phone.
And finally, there is maybe also optimization that I could try in the lib but could take time to find out what is the good settings for a particular phone. I've already done some pass on these settings during an optimization pass. But maybe could be tweaked for a particular device/architecture.</p>

<p>To complete to fix this bug and be able to distribute it I actually do for the market version, I'll need more info about the phone.
In fact, when the app starts the first time it download on the web the library that match the more its capabilities. For that I use system properties. So I'll need these properties to determine that your phone need this version of the lib (I didn't found any way to know the CPU arch from android, so I suppose that I'll have to use model or build.
So If you can install on your phone DeviceInfo (or some application that collect infos from the device) and send it to me would be nice :)</p>

It ~should~ download the library from the good place at first startup if you are on a freerunner (thanks to the device id you provided me in last comment).</p>

<p>But you must uninstall dev version before doing that. Else it will remain trying to load the old bundled armv4 version which is not compatible anymore with the java code.
In fact, on the market version, at startup (and upgrades), it check this file :

Look for the first matching library, download it and load it.</p>

<p>If there is a dev version previously installed (and not uninstalled), the native taken is the one available in a specific directory I use for devs version (to avoid this heavy process of downloading the lib). However this process is (should be if it work) really cool for armv4 support ... since market version should be compatible will all devices (armv4, armv5/6 and armv7 and in the future probably also x86)</p>

<p>Let me know if uninstalling and installing the market version makes things better. Else I'll ask you to help me to understand why it is not downloading the good version of the lib ;).</p></markdown-widget>

"adb install -r CSipSimple_0.00-15.apk" is conflicting with the old 13armv4t version. So each time I should first remove the app from the phone, before reinstalling the new version? Unfortunately the freerunner has no market support so I can only use the "apks" you provide in "downloads". Therefore my question is it fine to:
a) uninstall previous Csipsimple from phone
b) dowload your CSipSimple_0.00-15.apk 
c) do .adb install CSipSimple_0.00-15.apk 
d) reconfigure the Csipsimple with the correct provider infos?</p></markdown-widget>

However for next installs, you'll be able to just update the markets version and it will be fine. 
In the future, you must never try a dev version (0.00-xx-xx) but always 0.00-xx version (which doesn't have the .so inside).
So for 0.00-16.. you'll just need adb install -r CSipSimple_0.00-16.apk. And you'll not need to reconfigure everything (nor uninstall previously installed version).
Reinstall is just needed when switch from a dev version (0.00-xx-xx) to a "market" version 0.00-xx. (Or from 0.00-xx to 0.00-xx-xx)</p>

<p>In fact when I say market version it's just a production version (that is not debuggable and doesn't have .so files inside).</p></markdown-widget>

It would make non sense for an opensource project to distribute it only through the android market (which is a closed mean of distribution).
I'll try to distribute CSipSimple by all possible ways. </p>

<p>I do opensource, libre and with a good (I enforce to) ethic distribution and contributions. 
I do this precision cause, I'm a little bit afraid of the current debate between Google and Apple about "openness" of their stuff... They don't seems to make the difference between opensource, 'libre' and ethic which are three really different things ! 
CSipSimple like Firefox is Opensource, Libre and Ethic
Android is Opensource and Libre - the ethic of contributions and distribution made by Google of the project can be discussed
And iOS is not opensource, not libre... and I'll just avoid to talk about their ethic standards...</p>

<p>So yes, distribution of CSipSimple will remain ethic, and I'll also enforce to welcome all contributions to the projects if contributions make sense.</p>

<p>Sorry for the little digression, but I was discussing this morning with apple fanboys I work with about recent declaration of Andy Rubin and Steve Jobs about openess of android... And was amazed to see that the two CEO and also my colleagues doesn't really understand the diffs between software licences, project distributions and projects contributions.</p></markdown-widget>
