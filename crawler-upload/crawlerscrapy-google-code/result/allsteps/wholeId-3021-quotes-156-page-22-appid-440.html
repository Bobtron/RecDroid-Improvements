Sip providers doesn't always name things the same way.</p>

<p>The latest nightly builds : <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a> adds a field in advanced wizard for username and authentication name.
I guess that what you think should be used as caller id, is the username. And the username is the authentication name.
Caller ID is in fact the sip display name.
In sip packets it becomes something like that :
"Caller ID" </p>

<p>And authentication name is used when server challenge for an authentication.</p>

<p>So the nightly build advanced wizard could help.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you want to keep the market version you can also do that by transforming your advanced account into an expert one (long press the account row, and choose wizard and choose expert). Here you can set the AoR to exactly what you want. It's more complicated but gives a real access on what is sent by the underlying sip stack ;).</p></markdown-widget>

In this kind of configuration the account is for outgoing only and no registration step is made. So the app report green light and registered because the account is in theory valid for outgoing but no check with server has been done yet ;).
So the problem you have with registration just appears later for call.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's the solution but you talk about a caller id required in your first report. Many sip provider use this label for the user name.
 so maybe you could try to change sip id into
"...." </p>

<p>But I'm not sure it will help .In such case clean sip server report a user not found error.</p>

<p>So if it doesn't help, could you try to collect logs? See HowToCollectLogs wiki page.
Also ensure that the setting use compact mode is disabled ( a sip server that doesn't support that would report the same error than you get).
And last things if you get things working with another sip client I could translate from the working settings label into advanced or expert config in CSipSimple .</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I think the problem is the use of the "use compact mode" option (in settings &gt; network). Your sip provider seems to not support that correctly; so if you activate the option they think it's a bad request. It will probably go better once the "Use compact mode" will be turned off.</p>

<p>BTW, you should report a bug to this SIP provider :
For the technical information you can invoke that the compact header mode is defined here : Section 7.3.3 of RFC 3261 , and that it would be great if they support this mode that helps to reduce packet size which is important to reduce mobile network usage.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I tried the "use compact mode" option with no success (in fact it was off already when I went to check after reading your email). So I turned it on and then off again but did not help.</p>

<p>I also succeed at using it with BRIA, but the last version of this app is causing me a lot of issues so I de-installed it.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok. </p>

<p>So here's the equivalent configuration in csipsimple using a nightly build :</p>

<p>Use "Advanced wizard" :
In account display name : whatever you want (it's just for internal display)
Caller ID : leave blank
Server : as.voice.hcontrol.com
Username : 3056686472
Authorization name : leave blank
Password : 
Use tcp : disabled
Proxy : obp.voice.dsli.com</p>

<p>So, it's what you setup first time ;). 
Except obp instead of ob. (but I guess was just a mistake in the issue report -- else the initial error would be timeout). 
So the response is maybe elsewhere.</p>

<p>Make sure that use compact mode is disabled. It's the legacy mode ;).</p>

<p>And if it doesn't register (which would be consistent with your first test), it will be interesting if you can collect the logs and send it.</p>

<p>Then try to transform the account into an expert one (long press the account row, choose wizard expert).
Try to disable :
- Allow contact rewrite
- Enable RFC5626</p>

<p>Don't remove the registrar. It just hide the problem and we should first try to find the root cause. 
The "enable RFC5626" option is a candidate to be the root cause. Some very buggy hand written sip server doesn't support correctly the sip params and this option breaks them. There is one known from a NZ sip provider in this case.</p></markdown-widget>

I spent some time trying to connect the sip provider with fake credential and always got the 400 bad request... until ....
I changed the user agent !
Now I get the normal unauthorized error that I expect since I have no valid credentials for this server.</p>

<p>So to fix the problem I think that this will work :
Go in settings, press menu key to switch expert mode (if you didn't already switched to this expert global setting mode).</p>

<p>Then in network section edit the User agent field. Change it for example to 
Twinkle/1.2.4</p>

<p>Else, for the account setting, the first thing you did was absolutely correct :).</p>

<p>If this fixes the problem, there is a bug on server side ! They shouldn't reject CSipSimple user agent. 
I guess that's because it contains spaces : when default to CSipSimple, it becomes "CSipSimple / rxxxx / DEVICE-ID" while when setup to something different from csipsimple it's just the value you set. 
But as far as I know this is supported by sip RFC. </p>

<p>Let me know how it goes. :)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I'll push in next update something like "CSipSimple_DEVICE-ID/rxxxx" so for your server you don't need to change the user agent in next build. It also reduces number of characters used so good for network usage ;).</p>

<p>For the record : <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/SIP+user+agent+identification">http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/SIP+user+agent+identification</a></p>

<p>All sip user agent here with more than one "/" breaks sip server you are using ;). So if you encounter other sip client with same problem on this server.... the culprit is probably not the sip client but the fact its user-agent header is not properly managed by the server ;)</p></markdown-widget>

It was the agent name as you found out, brilliant.</p>

<p>I changed to Twinkle/1.2.4 and it immediately registered and I could make and receive calls. Thanks a lot again.</p>

<p>I'm not sure though what else to do after your last post regarding the agent name. Should I change to something else?</p>

<p>Also, should I keep the nightly version or revert to a market one?</p>

But you can keep "Twinkle/1.2.4" it will be fine :)</p>

<p>About the nightly or the market one, I advise you to keep nightly build. It should be stable enough for daily use. If you find something not working don't hesitate to feedback; it's very valuable for me to have nightly builds testers in order to release something very stable on android market.</p>
