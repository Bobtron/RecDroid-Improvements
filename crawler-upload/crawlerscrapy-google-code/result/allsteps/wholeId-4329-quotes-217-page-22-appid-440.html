<p>If you send me logs of incoming calls I can help you to detect whether SRTP offer is done by your Asterisk. I'm not an expert at Asterisk configuration so unfortunately I can't help you more on that conf point, but as it is described sounds simply to be due to the fact Asterisk do not offer SRTP and so as CSipSimple is configured to use SRTP as mandatory for calls it refuse the unsecure incoming call.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi r3gis.3R.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments.  Asterisk has been around for some time and works well with sRTP.  Most hard IP phones use sRTP with Asterisk.  In fact, I've got a Polycom SP 601 on my desk working fine with sRTP and my Asterisk node (both inbound and outbound) right now.  So the problem is not with Asterisk, but rather with CSipSimple.</p>

<p>To summarize my problems again:</p>

<p>For sRTP Mandatory setting
Calls from CSipSimple to another Asterisk extension work fine.  sRTP is enabled, and the packets are encrypted.</p>

<p>Calls from another Asterisk extension to CSipSimple do not work.  When Asterisk tries to pass the call on, CSipSimple rejects it with a 406 "Not Acceptable" response.</p>

<p>For sRTP Optional setting
Calls from CSipSimple to another Asterisk extension do not show up in the Asterisk log.  </p>

<p>Calls from another Asterisk extension to CSipSimple are connected, but in non-secure mode.  sRTP is not used.</p>

<p>If logs will help, I can certainly generate them, but want to make sure you understand the problem first.</p>

<p>Thaks.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm experiencing the same bug/problem, trying with Asterisk and Freeswitch but now I realized that the problem is in the CSipSimple client.</p>

<p>I'm trying to do calls with secure media(sRTP) between two CSipSimple clients and it doesn't work because when the inbound call arrives to a CSipClient(with mandatory sRTP), it responds with the "406 Not Acceptable" error. The freeswitch log shows the same problem(Overriding SIP cause 501 with 406 from the other leg ---&gt; HANGUP, cause: SERVICE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED).</p>

<p>Of course, I verified that both CSipSimple clients are configured with mandatory sRTP.</p>

<p>I'm testing with CSipSimple-r782-tls.apk version. I also tested with a version without TLS and the problem is the same, the bug has nothing to do with TLS.</p>

<p>I can do sRTP calls from a CSipSimple client to another gnu/linux softclient(for example, Blink Sip Client) without problems.</p>

<p>Can you solve it? I think that it could be easy, just the sRTP mandatory option that is missing somewhere where a call arrives.</p>

<p>Or can you point me in the right direction in the CSipSimple source code to solve it myself?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,
Jose</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Thanks for your fast response!</p>

<p>I have the srtp option set to mandatory globally and in the account(in expert mode) that I'm testing.</p>

<p>I attach here the log, look at the error at line 3260, a few lines before is the SDP offer.</p>

<p>Now I tried to do a direct call like you said but I can't set SRTP mandatory in that call, globally is mandatory but I cannot change in the local wizard and if I change to expert wizard it requires to set an "account id" and more fields regarding the server.</p>

<p>But anyway, we are not in the last case that you evoked, the offer is arriving to CSipClient with sRTP in the SDP.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

Jose</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, you're right packets sent by the asterisk server sounds good to me.</p>

<p>In fact, I'm not really an expert on that part. CSipSimple relies on the pjsip native library, and the problem we get is something that happens inside the pjsip library.
Usually this library is really reliable (and widely used on many other projects). </p>

<p>Most of the times problems appears because I do not set correct params ;). However, here what's weird is that using the test servers I can use that provide SRTP it works. So there is maybe something in this case that make things going wrong. Could be about config or inside pjsip. Regarding mailing list archives, there were not many tests done using asterisk so there is maybe something sent by asterisk that make pjsip being lost.</p>

<p>I was firstly thinking about some crypto suit not supported by pjsip when announced by asterisk's SDP, but it seems to be really close to the one pjsip sent... So... I'll try to investigate a little bit more by doing direct calls tests - with local accounts the srtp value should be the one of the global settings -.</p>

<p>Anyway I'll fix this little problem about the default value that was not taken into account. And I re-open the issue so that we can track progress on investigation on it. If you want to investigate on your side, you should have a look to the pjsip project. I never dived into the srtp mechanism so maybe the best way to ask for details if you have questions during your investigation is the pjsip mailing list.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I'm having exactly the same problem(406 Not Acceptable) with the latest version, CSipSimple-r839-tls.apk.</p>

<p>I think that the problem must be where you set SRTP(no, optional or mandatory) in the pjsip library related with incoming calls.</p>

<p>I'm starting to setup my Eclipse environment to work over your last trunk version to try to solve this. Now I'm looking at PjSipService.java.</p>

<p>Can you tell me any tip or important detail to be able to compile the .apk to test it in the phones?</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>I too have come across this issue.  I have been debugging the root cause of this error.  CSipSimple yield the following logcat message:</p>

<p>05-17 12:33:18.842: ERROR/libpjsip(7319):  12:33:18.845   pjsua_call.c  Error initializing media channel: Invalid SDP media transport for SRTP (PJMEDIA_SRTP_ESDPINTRANSPORT) [status=220227]</p>

<p>I've tracked the source of this down into pjsip in the following location:
transport_srtp.c in pjsip/project/pjmedia/src/pjmedia.  Specifically, line 1190:</p>

<p>1185         /* Validate remote media transport based on SRTP usage option.
1186          */
1187         switch (srtp-&gt;setting.use) {

1189                 if (pj_stricmp(&amp;m_rem-&gt;desc.transport, &amp;ID_RTP_SAVP) == 0)
1190                     return PJMEDIA_SRTP_ESDPINTRANSPORT;

1197                 break;
1198         }</p>

<p>What's very strange about this is that the pjmedia layer believes that SRTP is disabled even though I've set the SRTP mode in the user account as "Mandatory".  Something isn't being configured or passed down into the lower pjsip shared library.</p>

<p>Stay tuned...if/when I find more, I'll post it here.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I've looked in builds r841 and r865 and cannot find this magical global settings for srtp that you mention.  Within CSipSimple, from Settings &gt; Network, the only thing I see is an activity that shows "Transport", "NAT traversal", "For incoming calls", and "For outgoing calls".  I see no "Security".  Did I miss it?</p>

<p>The only SRTP setting I can find is associated with an account.  I created a Basic account, then changed its wizard to Expert.  Upon modifying the account, I see SRTP mode under "Proxy", which is now set to Mandatory.  </p></markdown-widget>

<p>My really bad for two reason :
In fact I was completely wrong when asking you to download the tls build cause that's not required for SRTP (I mistake with SIPS and ZRTP that both require TLS build, but not SRTP). So, first mistake...
And the second one, there is a bug in the code that José just pointed out and that I'll fix right now. So double shame on me ;).</p>

<p>The revision 866 will have this big mistake fixed and srtp should work again with TLS builds.</p>

<p>Really sorry for that and big thanks to José that investigated things and found my mistake.</p>

<p>I'll also fix the point about the fact the SRTP option should be there in all releases cause for now there is something wrong that also check that it's a TLS build to show you the SRTP option while it's not needed ;).</p></markdown-widget>
