1. Using Google Voice to forward calls to CallCentric registered in CSipSimple
2. Be sure CallCentric is registered properly (green status)
3. Place Call to Google Voice number</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
The expected response is for CSipSimple to almost immediately begin ringing and allowing me to answer to the call. Instead, CSipSimple doesn't detect the calls at all and my phone never rings OR I get one ring and then the call is missed. The calling line will have experienced 7 or 8 rings prior to this time.</p>

<p>Please note - when I forward my GV calls to a LAN line or a real mobile number, the delay is almost 0. I don't understand what is taking CSipSimple so long to pick up the call. (CallCentric shows that the calls are registered on-time)</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what device / operating</b>
<b>system?</b>
CSipSimple 1.01.00 r2351 and r2352 (I've tried both recently)
Galaxy Note II, Android 4.2</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>I tried forwarding the call from CallCentric to a landline and the connection still was almost instant. I know the issue is not CallCentric receiving the call, rather I'm confident that it's just CSipSimple not connecting to the server often enough to pick up the call nearly instantly. I don't care if it drains my battery, I need to get these calls!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The possible reason why the app could not ring immediately is that the phone is in deep sleep mode (in this mode network layer of the phone is sleeping and the application might possibly not be awaken if there is a problem in the ROM of the device that does not wakup apps when there is some network activity).</p>

<p>That's why my first question is : when the problem occurs is the phone screen on? If yes, the problem is probably that the sip packet sent by callcentric server simply arrives late on the sip client. Maybe a problem on callcentric config (I don't know if they have a way to delay calls and try on various things before trying sip device). To be sure, I would be interested by logs (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/HowToCollectLogs?wl=en">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/HowToCollectLogs?wl=en</a>) that could help to see if there is a big delay between packet received from server and ringing action of the phone.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I could assist with the logs, but let me make a few statements first:
1. This happens with my phone screen on and unlocked OR screen off, doesn't matter. I have my ROM set to not sleep (I don't care about the battery life as much).
2. This happens to me both on my 4G LTE connection (perfect bars) and over WiFi - same issue.
3. I've tried meddling with the (new)STUN/ICE settings, Connection keep alive settings (Interval for KA packets). I don't know if there is an "optimal setting"
4. I didn't do an expert setup for CallCentric, rather I used the regular wizard to set it up by default.</p>

<p>This experiment is really easy to repeat - If I use GVcallback (Voice+ from the Play Store) and I have it call my other cell phone, it is nearly immediate. When I have it call my CallCentric number, sometimes it takes 10-15 seconds before my phone ever rings and when it does, it ends without giving me a chance to answer. Other times, it doesn't answer at all.</p>

<p>Of course, it's also easily repeated just by having anyone call my Google Voice number.</p>

<p>Please let me know how you'd like me to log this information and which parameters to use. I'll do anything I can to help! </p></markdown-widget>
