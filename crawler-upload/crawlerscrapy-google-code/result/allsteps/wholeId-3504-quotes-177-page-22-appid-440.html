1. reboot phone;

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
As soon as a network is found connected, registration should be fired up.</p>

r1047 installed on a Motorola Defy, flashed with Gingerbread.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I have to re√≠nstall CSipSimple to have this problem sorted out. It is not exclusive to r1047. I have noticed it in the last couple of nightly builds. Can't precise in what build it started, though.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>There is a problem with registration on the Samsung Galaxy Mini (Android 2.2.1). I added a new account and it won't register (and there isn't any network activity also). I tried to Force Close the application and restart it again, and I even restarted my phone. The result is the same. The account is inactive with a yellow bar under it.If I press on the icon next to the account (to deactivate it ) and then again ( to reactivate it), nothing happens. </p>

<p>I've attached the logs.</p>

<p>Thanks, and keep up the good work.</p>

<p>Is the app installed on your SD card on your Galaxy Mini? 
Regarding logs the app does not find the native library (which explains that nothing starts). 
It tries to search on /data/data/com.csipsimple/lib/libpjsipjni.so and does not find it. 
It could be a bug when it's on sdcard, or something I should try to manage on some special manufacturer's rom : if they don't implement correctly the android api that should allow developper to find the folder where libs are stored, I could try a more basic way.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>In fact, other versions of the app can work fine, but these 2 new ones are very very different. You'll see when you'll build all the native library comes from a different place :). 
So there is probably something broken with these new builds. I'll try to investigate if you find a clue on your side do not hesitate to share :).</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>BTW... I'm thinking about that, Freerunner runs android armv4t...
So you need a special csipsimple build to run that.
For example :</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-13-armv4t.apk&amp;can=1&amp;q=#makechanges">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-13-armv4t.apk&amp;can=1&amp;q=#makechanges</a></p>

<p>I did discontinue the support of that. Actually you're right, this device is absolutely not supported by android because the CPU is not supported.
All apps that have native library part will not work. CSipSimple has native library part. Sipdroid not.</p>

<p>If I get time I can try to have the NDK working again with armv4t arch. But will not be right now ;).</p></markdown-widget>
