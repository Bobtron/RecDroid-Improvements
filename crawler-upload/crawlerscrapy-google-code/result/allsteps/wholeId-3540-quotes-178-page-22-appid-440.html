1.Calling with Csip using bluetooth works fine &amp; get connected call generated from Csip</p>

<p>2.During SIP call if another call (GSM) comes in, Csip automaticaly disconnect recent sip call and connects to GSM call without any notification.</p>

<p>3.While using Csip withouth Bluetooth, No notification is made for Incoming calls.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>The Audio is disconected from Bluetooth &amp; Earpiece is connected. Have to Re-Boot to make it normal.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
0.02-03 r944. GingerBread 2.3.3 (SGS2)  BB:XXKG5</p>

Fixed in revision 1571. Will be produced tonight in nightly build website.</p>

<p>The way to activate the option is to :
Go in filters rules, go in GSM/stock dialer account, add a rule "Force call" with as matching type "Bluetooth".</p>

<p>Alternatively, even if not recommanded, you could use as account to force call with a SIP account. But SIP doesn't plays well with current mobile data networks (3G etc), so packets get drop and audio quality can be awful while moving from one cell to another.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>It also fixes the call wait problems. And has better user interface :)
If you find any issue on the nightly, don't hesitate to feedback. It allows me to produce a better release on the market.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Its giving "408/request terminated" error in the end.</p>

<p>New is also User Interface is impressive, hmm ICS type.</p>

<p>Sorry, but for time being I have downloaded MobileVoip to use. I'll wait

<p>I've downloaded 1571 also &amp; tested. It works good but there are some bugs:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can hear CALL WAIT (thanks for adding) but it beeps on for couple of
seconds only. ##....##....#......... order</li>
</ul>

<p>** When the GSM call is answered the SIP(VOIP) call does not disconnects or
does not have option to END or HOLD! I think VOIP call should get ENDED/
Disconnected when we pickup GSM call.</p>

<p>***After Exit CSIPSIMPLE the normal phone TONES are too weak until I make
any further native  GSM call from phone.</p>

<p>I'll send more information as I use it.</p>

<p>I'm Sorry if I am bothering you in between your work. Hope we'll get better
bug free app.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance &amp; Best Regards</p>

Was the reset settings helpful? I'm trying to fix the thing I think to be the root cause of buggy migration. If you can confirm that the reset was the solution. Or did you try an install from scratch by removing the app before?</p>

<p>About the call wait, it indeed beeps for only few seconds. I was also very surprised about that, but that's the way it's done in source code of stock android app. I wonder if they have some feedback about waiting call several times so that the call wait is repeated, but in SIP we don't have that. So I'll probably need to simulate that on my side. I'll also try to check how it actually do in GSM with waiting GSM call.</p>

<p>For point 2, you can read my comments in issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=388">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=388</a> .</p>

<p>In fact the call is already automatically on HOLD. You have probably not yet discovered how CSipSimple manage hold, transfer conference ;). 
In fact, all is done by drag'n'dropping call cards. So, you can try to just long press the call card that is normally on the upper right corner of the screen (since hold, background is yellow too), and drop it to the hangup area to hangup or the center of the screen to resume the call. The drag and drop is a little bit like what you do with icons on the android home screen.
If you don't like drag and drop, you can also press the little arrow under the call card, you'll discover a menu where you can control the communication associated to this call. 
It's done like that because the app may be able to manage more than one call at a time (if allowed in settings).
Also, normally when you'll disconnect the GSM call, the SIP call will automatically be resumed. 
Another possibility is that your SIP server/provider doesn't support HOLD feature. In this case, there is nothing I can do, and it's a bug on server side.</p>

<p>For your point 3, I'll have a look. It's probably due to some sound level I don't reset. </p>

<p>Don't hesitate if you find something else, it's very interesting for me to get feedback as I don't test every use cases.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I have re installed 1571 from scratch by removing old app. It worked then &amp;
I tried to update to 1572 and now that is also working fine except the
points I've mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>*Hope you'll find solution for CALL WAIT loop. Kindly make it little louder
also, if possible.</p>

<p>**Regarding the HOLD option of CSIPSIMPLE, I've checked it during testing,
but I think better to have Call END feature rather then HOLD feature when
we pick up GSM call because the incoming GSM conversation could be for
longer time also (I feel like this);  Or SIPSIMPLE can HOLD voip call for
couple of seconds and then ENDs up after it, I can't say whether it is
possible or not?</p>

<p>***Waiting to have it resolved in next build.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Regarding point 2, could be an option to end the call, but I don't think that it should be different than regular GSM call by default. 
When you answer a GSM call while you have another GSM call, it just put on hold the first call. It goes the same on all enterprise pbxes I know. </p>

<p>Then it's up to user to decide if he want to hangup or not the held call, or to resume the held call, say something and hangup; or directly hangup without resuming to tell bye.</p>

<p>I think it should be the same with a SIP call for consistency. And that's what is expected by users used to manage multiple calls.
Besides, normally if you answer a call while in communication with somebody else, you'll remind that you were 2 seconds before in call with somebody else, and will be able to decide what to do with the held call.</p>

<p>Most of the time from my user experience, when I see there is another incoming call on my enterprise phone :
1- I decide if the second call is important and should be answered... if so :
2- I say on ongoing call : "Please wait I've a second call"
3- I take the ongoing call
4- a) If I see this call will be long and is more important than the first one, I say hold one second please, I hold this one, resume the other and tell him I'll call back in the estimated time of the important call.
4- b) If this call is finally less important or will take more time and should be treated after, I say him that I'll call back later, hangup and resume the held call.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from my experience (my full time job is for enterprise PBXes), it's the way almost all users manages multiple calls.</p>

<p>In your proposal, it means that you may hangup an ongoing call without being able to talk a lot because often overflow may occurs quickly. 
And if that's a very important call incoming you want to take the call very quickly which will hangup the ongoing call without saying a world which is a little bit rude for your ongoing call, isn't it ? ;).</p>

<p>So it could be an option, but I wonder if such an option is not over-engineering because I don't know any modern call management system that does that (even with an option). </p></markdown-widget>
