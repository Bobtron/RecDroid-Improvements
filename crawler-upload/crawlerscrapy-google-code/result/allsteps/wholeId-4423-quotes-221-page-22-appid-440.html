<p>Applications are just system applications like contact browsing or internet browser, none of those use audio.</p>

<p>After detecting such issue I made another test. I ran TuneIn Radio connected via wifi to a 128kbps internet radio stream. This played always perfect (and with good quality) in any case, like terminal in complete standby or multitasking with other applications, even with internet browser. I tried such application both with 'use internal MP3' on and off.</p>

<p>Good thing is that I used TuneIn for all this afternoon and for each incoming sip call TuneIn has stopped playing, restarting automatically when call terminated, showing good integration of such application and csipsimple into the o.s.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As this driver pass its audio frames to the JVM it is impacted by the JVM garbage collector process that may freeze the process. It's probably more noticeable on devices that has less RAM or are configured to do more agressive garbage collection.
The OpenSL-ES driver is not affected by this problem. So OpenSL-ES driver will fix this issue. Problem is that you'll need android 2.3 on your device ... But that's the ~only~ solution I think.

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well, after a lot of research on this issue, I found something really interesting.</p>

<p>CSipSimple was setting thread priority using the native standard posix thread API. The native standard way. But after a closer look on android source code, it seems that android does not only use this to decide whether a thread is important or not.
The android scheduler (actually the linux one + some stuff from android), also manage thread groups. And when I was changing the thread priority the group of the thread was left unchanged. </p>

<p>As consequence the thread was set with a very high priority but not in a good group. I guess that on some device it had a big impact and on other device where the thread grouping impact less the way the scheduler manage it, it had a lower impact.</p>

<p>So, I did the change in the revision 859 for the trunk nightly to use the java API instead of the native API (the java API should do every things hidden by the android OS, included the group change).</p>

<p>If some can test it and let me know how it goes :

<p>CALL_PRIVILEDGED is only for specific cases and that's not hurting to not get this priviledge.
