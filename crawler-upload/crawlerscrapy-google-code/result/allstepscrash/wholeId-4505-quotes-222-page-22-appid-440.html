Some sip servers, such as ekiga - example I well know-, refuse to register with a private url and you need to provide them directly your public IP which is done by STUN.
So maybe, activating stun will help. </p>

<p>Else you can try to use the new "record logs" feature available from menu &gt; help. And send me what is happening, maybe the full trace is more verbose about the bad gateway error.
Or, it's maybe something to see with sipsorcery ... if works well with your other sip provider... no? (Or another thought, maybe your 3G carrier that block sipsorcery domain.... )</p></markdown-widget>

I've seen this thread on the sipsorcery forum, but didn't really relate to it since it seems to work perfectly fine over wifi.
The interesting part is that it also isn't a mobile provider issue since I had sipdroid running until yesterday with exactly the same settings I am trying to use now with CSIsimple.
I tried the STUN, using stun01.sipphone.com, didn't work either.
I also observed that the application is going nuts when I try to register to sipsorcery over 3G or HDSPA, it kind of slows down the entire system.
I didn't really get worm with the log file extraction, is there a way to limit the log to CSIsipmle only since I find everything in there?</p></markdown-widget>

It doesn't resolve sipsorcery at all. So can't reach it. The question is... why it doesn't resolve... nor android, nor pjsip sip stack...
Could be cause blacklisted on your carrier DNS :S. But would not explain why it worked with sipdroid previously installed on your phone.
You can try to use expert wizard (while editing your account use menu choose wizard to switch to another wizard) to replace registrar uri from
sip:sipsorcery.com to sip:69.59.142.213 : it will avoid dns resolution.</p>

<p>See then if it goes far than just dns resolution. Should at least try to reach the sipsorcery server.</p>

<p>For update of new csipsimple dev versions :
 * Indeed there is an open issue about saving account settings.. I know that's not easy for now to be a alpha testor ...
 * If you are already using dev version, you can install it using adb and force the update to keep your settings (there is an option on adb  install -r CSipSimple.apk (it will keep your datas).</p></markdown-widget>

I was wondering whether I could push the timeout limit in CSIPsimple to 3600s and the keep alive to 120s in order to reduce battery impact.
The timeout is an important reason for the use of TCP, I suppose you implemented TCP for that purpose </p></markdown-widget>

<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=81">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=81</a>
and 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=50">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=50</a>
that are also mentioning the link from sipdroid.
Let me know how it goes. However regarding the sipdroid code, I'm not sure they definitely use what they announce in this wiki page.</p>

<p>Well, here in csipsimple, you can play with these values. So try it and let me know how it goes.
I know that on some 3G networks in some countries it has to be reduced (timeout reduce and keep alive increased) to be able to still receive calls after a while (15 minutes for example).</p>

<p>I didn't get time to really test values and impacts on the battery.
But if you could test would be nice to share your results so that I could introduce bests results as default values.
I'm sure that using two account consume more battery than only one ;), that increasing log level also consume more battery, having a sip provider that constantly send Notify or Option also increase.... but I don't know exactly what is the impact of timeouts and keep alive. So would be really interested by tests on this point!</p>

<p>There is apps that monitor battery and display battery graph. Maybe could be useful to compare result trying to keep scenario as much as possible the same between each test.</p>

<p>About the first issue you had, if putting IP solve the problem, I think that there is something with DNS of your mobile carrier. 
Still two strange points :
 * that other sip client succeeded, unless they do cache with DNS resolution, (which I think is a bad idea when you have an enterprise ip-pbx).
 * other accounts you have succeed in resolving dns names of other server (which make me think that the DNS is reachable and can resolve other domain names)</p>

<p>I mark the issue as closed but I keep it in mind. And if somebody else have the same problem, I'll reopen it. 
Keep me in touch about your result on timeout and keep alive. You can put your results on the issue 81 (I think it's the right place about this optimisation)</p></markdown-widget>
