<p>Sometimes when I'm on wifi, I like to open my sip client and leave it running in the background to receive calls and be integrated with the dialer/call log.  When I want to go back to cellular or no longer receive my incoming sip calls, I exit the client. </p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be any way to do this with csipsimple at the moment.  If I check to integrate with android, the client always starts itself and hijacks my outgoing calls when I'm on wifi.  There should be a way to open the client and have it running persistently and integrated but also easily exit it entirely.  Both sipdroid and 3cx operate in this fashion.</p>

<p>Thanks for a great client!</p></markdown-widget>

<ul>
<li>If voip is not registered/available then it should default to dial by mobile without prompting (maybe making this a configuration option).</li>
<li>If making a call via bluetooth (voice dial) one has to still select the 'connection' to use which is a problem for handsfree operation. Perhaps a default dial option should be made available so this prompt doesn't appear, or even better detect whether the call was initiate via voice dial and use a configured 'connection' in that case.</li>

For sam first point : use "Available on wifi" in easy settings and you can tweak more in details in Network settings if you want to lock wifi or not.</p>

<p>Same thing for integration to native dialer, there is an option in User interface</p>

<p>for marc remarks :
* If voip is actually not available on the network you are (and you configured properly easy settings for what you want) it will not ask you for choice !!</p>

<p>For bluetooth, unfortunately, for now android bluetooth api is poor, but voice dial is a good idea, I'll keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Guys just try the settings, and if you are using the developpement version (the one available on this website you can switch to expert mode)... You'll see that the client is highly tweakable !!!! I just doesn't underline these options cause I consider that mainstream users doesn't matters... But I also really attached to provide power users a way to tweak the app..;.
So just play with settings you'll be pleased.... 
And if you want to contribute, you can write documentations about how to configure it. For now I'm really focused on the code itself... And there is poor doc on the project.</p></markdown-widget>

If I choose available on wifi, the program will run like a service and be continuously registered/restarted if killed, but I lose the exit button I get with always outgoing.  I know its just an extra couple clicks for the user but I think it would be nice if I could get the program to run like a service AND tell it to exit when I'm done with it without having to change settings each time I use it.  </p>

<p>As far as the integration, same goes with having to go into the settings and change stuff when I want to start or quit using the client.  If I set only outgoing (so I can exit the client), integrate with android and exit the client and then try to place a call (fully intending it be over cellular of course, the sip client is closed intentionally), the client starts itself and tries to register and intercepts my call.  I'm sure some desire that behavior but to me its obnoxious. To avoid it I need to go in and uncheck integrate everytime I'm done using the client.</p>

<p>Bottom line is there doesn't seem to be a way to make the program start and run persistently when called with integration and then exit for real when asked without changing settings each use. I think users coming from sipdroid or 3cx may find this frustrating.  </p>

<p>I'll grab the devel version and see if I can tweak it to work in this fashion.  If I can, I'll write a doc for you so people don't ask this again ;)</p></markdown-widget>

There is also a home screen widget that could help a lot :)</p>

<p>Besides, try to <em>never</em> kill a running service. In android 2.2 it has been disabled for third party apps which is a really good thing. Apps such as task killer are really bad things cause they put in mind of users that if an app is in the task list it means that the app is doing something, which is absolutely wrong : sometime android keep in ram an app freezed and the app does nothing. </p>

<p>For your second point : there is one open point about the fact it doesn't automatically deregister if gsm is choosen. I've to fix that but have to be able to manage multiple calls before (Even if seems to be not linked, it is actually ;) ).</p>

<p>You can also choose to deactivate android integration (Settings &gt; User interface) if you are not pleased with the fact it constantly ask you (and you can also use filters (read the FAQ ) to choose which phone number it should ask you for choosing).</p></markdown-widget>
