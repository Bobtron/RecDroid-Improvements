<p>In this case, you probably want to make direct SIP to SIP calls.</p>

<p>This is absolutely possible with CSipSimple with the existing version (and with nightly builds too <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a> that gives in screen indication on local IP).</p>

<p>Just configure a "Local" account (in wizard generic section), on each device. Then switch to text dialing mode (the little TXT menu button while in dialer)
and try to dial :
test@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP of the other device. (the "test" username doesn't really matter you can put anything you'd like instead). (alternatively you can also dial sip:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)</p>

<p>You will find the ip in the local account interface so that it's not too hard to share.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can have on sip server on any of the node of your network and register all sip clients to this node. This may be easier for users because no need to know IP of individial clients but only the one of the sip server node of your network. This is obviously free and you just need to install a sip registrar on the network. You can have a look to freeswitch project for example, it's pretty easy to install.</p></markdown-widget>

<ol>
<li><p>It's incorrect. I just configured both my phone and tablet with 'local' accounts and switched off tablet's wifi (thus forcing OpenGarden mesh to connect), and CSipSimple went offline (even tho I'm submitting this FROM said 'offline' tablet...).</p></li>
<li><p>OG is not designed for local networking, but meshing of multiple local devices, for multihop global networking. Talkatone, as I type this, on an 'offline' device, is connected and registered just fine, thru OG-&gt;phone-&gt;interwebs...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And 3. He neither stated that he had a system upon which to install a sip server, nor that he wanted to do this.  And, it would not work in an OG use case anyhow, as there's no need for OG if/when there's infrastructure to which to connect one...</p>

<p>Quit making uneducated excuses for bad code.  Make your software try to find the net, rather than lazily ask the system if there's a connection to it (as its doing now).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>Thanks for your update it might allow to understand more the initial need.
I admit that I may have misunderstood the initial request.</p>

<p>However I'm not looking for an excuse. 
AND if you find there bad code... PLEASE... it's OpenSource project !!! Help us instead of being aggressive and try to make constructive remarks and it will be very welcome. If you think you can do better and find some bad code I beg, help to make the project better.
Keep in mind I'm almost alone making that on my free time just as a hobby primarily and I try to do the support as well.. and don't always get the needs of all users (all the more so as there is a single line to describe the problem...). If you have better ideas than my replies it will be welcome.</p>

<p>Then coming back to the actual problem. 
You have to know that CSipSimple rely on an opensource and widely used in other products sip stack. It's highly configurable and you have a direct access to settings of the sip stack. So to configure a SIP account you have everything you need. I have big doubts on the fact this sip stack contains crappy code -- all the more so as it's not me that developed this part... only the android port--.</p>

<p>What's done by the app, and could be my crappy code, is the detection of the network connection I do (if the app considers the phone not connected USING ANDROID API, it will not try to connect). So maybe there's something with the way the app detects the network connection. For your information I did read a lot core android source code and even contributed patch to it. And this particular part is directly taken from source code of the stock sip application extended to support more network kinds. So it should not be so bad code.</p>

<p>Despites of the fact users thinks it's primarily a problem with CSipSimple, it's often a problem with the app trying to simulate the network connection (for example some apps working only on rooted phone to share a connection over USB etc). If these apps do not send correct Android intent and report correct Android connectivity status, the app will not consider the network active. In this case there is possible workarounds in the app (such as connecting 'anyway' option), but you can't tell it's csipsimple code the culprit.... as if the android connectivity status reported by android SDK is wrong... it's culprit of what's trying to simulate the connectivity that doesn't integrates android SDK. 
But it could be something with the app. I don't reject this hypothesis but I need more than just one line to describe the problem to be able to find out what's going on... and your long comment doesn't help me too even if gives me some more indications.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Trying to find the Net instead of CLEANLY ask android system using android SDK for which kind of connection is EXCATLY what's done by the option "Connect Anyway" in network settings.</p>

<p>But I considers it's much more clean to check with android system what is the kind of connection and allow users to choose when they'd like the sip connection to be active.</p>

<p>If you don't think so, IMHO it's you that makes bad code because if there is an Android SDK it should not be ignored. And using private API is usually bad idea even if it's possible in the application ... BUT only as FALLBACK and only if users use the ExpertSettingMode or for some feature but it's done cleanly and assuming the private API could not exists.</p></markdown-widget>
