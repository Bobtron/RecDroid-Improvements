It's not as polished as Bria or Acrobits and that's a big turn off for me. I would imagine it's not that difficult to make csipsimple look like the native phone dialer. </p>

<p>I know csipsimple from many years ago and while it has improved tremendously I must say the interface was cleaner before than now. Why label contacts "txt"? Why not put a people icon like everyone else? The bottom screen should contain 4 icons with text description. (Phone, Contacts, History and Settings).</p>

<p>And why with the big smiley face during a call that takes up most of the screen? Why not put an Android like sipdroip or the mute, keypad, speaker, hold, add call and more buttons there? Just look at Bria how clean it is.</p>

<p>Don't understand me wrong. I think csipsimple is one of the best sip clients for Android and it's amazing that it's on par or better than Bria or Acrobits which are the leader on the field. I just think it should look nicer and needs a better UI. </p></markdown-widget>

<li><p>CSipSimple dialer screen code comes from stock android 4.x source code. So the theme is really the same one than the stock dialer's one ;).</p></li>
<li><p>CSipSimple is opensource and it's possible to build your own version of it with the UI you like. It's also possible to make themes (if you want to retrieve old themes you can download it from play store). 
If you want your own theme, the only thing you need is to take time to do that or ask somebody to do that. Keep in mind it's an opensource project. And nothing will land with incantations. 
In terms of user interface things are very subjective. There is probably others people have same opinion than yours and maybe also others with same than mine. I currently think the UI with my needs in the head, but if other have other ideas and wants to do other themes for the apps I'll be pleased to help them to develop that and contribute that on the community. Just don't ask me to do on my free time something I don't see the benefit. There is so many other features to implement that are not yet feasible as extension (theme) of the app.</p>

<ul><li><p>The "txt" is not contact. CSipSimple dialer doesn't focus on giving you access to your contact. This has been debated 100 times. And I keep thinking integrating a good way the other applications (stock contact app, other contact apps preferred by users..) is very very very very very better solution than trying to reinvent the wheel inside csipsimple. My opinion is that 99% users should continue using their normal dialer and contact app and don't change their habit. Then the filtering rules and the integration to android should do the rest. So the goal of "txt" is absolutely not contact; It's there just as shortcut but it's not the goal. The goal here is to allow users to dial full sip uri. Real sip uri. Maybe you have not the need of it, but some users have. And it's important to bring this feature. Proprietary apps like bria doesn't care about these users. CSipSimple does.
I develop the app on my free time (night and week ends). I've few free times those days and I always develop things as hobby. So if I'm personally pleased with the UI, the only solution you have is to try to convince me (it can works on some topics if you have good arguments -- better than "I hate the call screen") or to develop things on your side and take of your free time to develop. </p></li>
<li><p>There is still things to improve inside csipsimple like the favorite tab that should bring the sip presence share feature. This will take a lot of time too. And choosing between trying to implement all user interface of all users wish and implementing real features an extensible way (that can be presented differently by other apps using csipsimple api), I will (as far as I'm concerned) always choose the latest option.</p></li>
<li><p>The big smile screen is because your contact has no photo. Look the stock android app... you'll see it looks like the same. I try to take as model the android user interface. Not what is done by other apps that just have same interface between iOS and Android which I think a very bad approach. Google took time to define a new way to interact, developers should try to get inspiration from that. Besides when video will land, you'll maybe see advantage of this layout too. The main problem right now with the call screen interface is the height of the bottom bar. But IMHO the rest is just fine. Another point, csipsimple here is also extensible and allows third party plugins to add features while in call. For example text2speech, soundboard etc etc. Proprietary apps are closed and doesn't allows extensiblity here so they can just hardcode things and think a fix layout user interface.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to have a look to csipsimple api to write your own app that have an user interface that suit your needs, you can look here :
<a href="http://r3gis3r.github.com/SampleCSipSimpleApp/javadoc/">http://r3gis3r.github.com/SampleCSipSimpleApp/javadoc/</a>
This allows any third party app to reimplement csipsimple user interface. This is not allowed by narrow minded proprietary applications. CSipSimple allows to do that, and that's the way concerns of users not pleased with the current user interface should go. And if it happens that's objectively better than current csipsimple user interface it can replace it, and I'll put mine as a plugin instead.</p></li>
<li><p>That said, replying this issue took some of my free time and deserved the progress on another real features (well it's a geek feature but a feature ;) ). But I think was good to remind what's behind the project and why goes this way, and that you are free to build on top on the way it goes if you are not pleased with it.</p></li></ul></li>

Writing my own interface is probably beyond my capabilities. DCI uses data SIMs to provide VoIP lines on cell phones so we want the VoIP dialer to look as much as possible as the native dialer but we like for calls to originate in the VoIP client not the native dialer so our customer does not see 2 interfaces.</p>

<p>That means of course our needs are different than those of other users but it also means we have a lot of experience in how end users relate to VoIP and VoIP clients in general.  </p>

<p>For example I needed to switch to the "expert wizard" to define our voice mail access number when IMHO this should be defined in the "Basic Wizard" as the expert wizard should not be used by anyone unless they REALLY know what they are doing but the VM access number has to be defined by everyone.</p>

<p>I also think that there should be a button for VM access to the left of the "phone" icon even though pressing and holding the "1" key dials the voice mail. That space is currently empty anyways.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Normally as soon as you press the VM button in dialer and have no VM number configured, you'll get a prompt to enter the voice mail number. So no need to convert account to expert wizard. Besides, when I get the information from the sip provider, it's included in the wizard and user will not bother with that ;)</p>

<p>I agree. 
In fact this empty place was planned to hold the video call button (and actually it does as soon as the experimental video plugin is installed and enabled). But it didn't land as fast as I wished. 
So, I think a good solution will be to have it somehow automatic and fallback to voice mail if no other action button are available and have video if video is available + enabled. (and maybe also have a menu on long press to allow : video, voice mail, and a new "apply filter").</p></markdown-widget>
