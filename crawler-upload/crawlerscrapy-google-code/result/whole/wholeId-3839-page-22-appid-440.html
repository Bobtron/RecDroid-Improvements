<p>As for point 2 : this feature depends on your server. Are you sure that your SIP server send you Notify about the fact you have new voice messages? If so can you try to capture (use the embedded log recorder - see HowToCollectLogs wiki page- ).
Else, check with your sip provider, many providers does not give this feature to their users... in this case, no magic, CSipSimple can't get the info ;).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Yes, normally the idea is to have that done in each wizard. The goal is to try to cover as much sip providers as possible and if it's a known provider user should not care about the number cause the wizard already know it :).</p>

<p>I think that the fact it is complicated is not a so bad idea :</p>

<p>Having it somewhere else will complicate things for <em>all</em> users while they should not care about that (it should be done in the wizard automatically)</p>

<p>I try to keep the interface and the global feeling in the app very simple. You'll argue that it sounds much more complicated to you to change the voice mail number, but I think that it would be even worse to add 100 options for all users everywhere in the app... that would be more simple for me, but the user will be lost in so many settings. 
You don't imagine how many settings that could be presented to an user to configure a sip account. Actually, you could have an idea with the expert mode... one settings of expert mode could be absolutely required for one user... should I put that in the basic wizard?? I don't think so.</p>

<p>I think that if you really have the problem : 
 * mistake the first time 
 * use your sip voice mail
 * have a sip provider without wizard with prefilled voice mail number yet
I don't know which % of user it is but I guess less than 1% of users.</p>

<p>Hopefully this 1% of users will search or ask (just like you did, and that's a really good reaction :) ).</p>

<p>And in this case, two good news : 
1 - feedback about the fact there is possibly one missing wizard + voice mail number to set automatically and something that I could fix easily so that all other users of the same provider will not have the problem anymore
2 - the user will be able to solve his problem.</p>

<p>Also, that's not so hard to do : you just have to long press on an existing account change it to expert wizard mode (choose wizard option and expert), edit, change VM number, save and if you want then switch back to the previous wizard.
Do you change this number each day? I hope not ;)... so about 5 minutes for all the rest of the usage time of the app... </p></markdown-widget>

That's a really good idea, but in case the sip server is badly configured, and it occurs on few mainstream sip servers, it will crap the configuration. Since it would be blocking for a couple of users, I postponed that. Thinking again about that make me thing that I could add an hidden option in global settings (with default true) to get infos from notification for voice mail number. And if the server behaves badly to add a wizard (if not exists) that automatically turn off this feature, and say users that face the problem of a server that does not return the correct voice mail number to manually disable it in settings.</p>

<p>About the FAQ entry, you're right, I'll add that right now.</p></markdown-widget>
