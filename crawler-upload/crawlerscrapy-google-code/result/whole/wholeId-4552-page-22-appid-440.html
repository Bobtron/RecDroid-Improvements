<p>There is experimental settings that could help to ensure you'll always receive calls.</p>

<p>(Assuming you have set easy configuration to "Always available" profile)</p>

<p>You can tweak the account re-registration time and keep alive.
To do so, while editing the account press "Menu" and then choose wizard. Choose Expert wizard. Then you'll automatically return to the account list and notice that the icon of your account has changed. It's now an expert account (pre-filled with values from the previous wizard). You can edit it. And you'll see now a lot of new fields.</p>

<p>Some users living in countries with special data coverage reported me that setting these values improve their availability :</p>

<p>Re-Register (register timeout) : 184
Keep Alive : 100 </p>

<p>Let me know how it goes, I'd be interested by feedback with these values to add a "High availability profile" in settings that could make easier this process :).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>I tried CSIPSimple on my Samsung Galaxy S Captivate and having the same problems with calls through freephoneline.ca over 3G - no audio.  I tried playing around with some of the settings and the only setting that seems to make a difference is the UDP port.  </p>

<p>I had this same issue using freephoneline service at home through a softphone.  The way it was resolved with the help of freephoneline.ca tech support, was that I had to open UDP ports 5060, 5061, 6060, 6061, 13000, and 13001 on my router.  If not all of these ports were open I only got one-way audio and it seemed to change depending on which port I opened.</p>

<p>Since you can only specify one UDP port in the settings of CSIPSimple, I wander if this may be causing the issue.  Is there a way to somehow be able to specify 6 UDP ports in the settings?</p>

<p>Also, could someone may be make a pre-configured account setting for freephoneline.ca in the list of accounts? The sip settings for freephoneline.ca are actually very simple:</p>

<p>Username: your freephoneline account phone number (1xxxxxxxxxx)
Password: password you get with your sip settings file
proxy: voip.freephoneline.ca
UDP Ports: 5060, 5061, 6060, 6061, 13000, and 13001</p>

<p>That's all that should be needed for it to work.</p>

<p>Love the app, too bad it does not work.</p>

<p>PS. Works fine over wifi becuase home router has proper ports open.
Not a carrier issue - I'm on Rogers 3G and freephoneline works fine through fring.</p></markdown-widget>

Did you try ICE + STUN on latest dev version (<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a>) ?
Really sounds a network issue (NAT network cause 3G is natted and need your to activate at least STUN and maybe ICE too). Cause if it works on wifi it mean that the problem doesn't come from the device itself but to the way CSipSimple is announcing it's own IP address. 
In a NATed network, it require the help of a working STUN server to announce a correct IP. In others android sip client stun is by default activated but I do not cause else problem is worse for people in russia, in china and in other countries where the public network is not directly plugged to the public network where the default STUN server is.</p></markdown-widget>

I guess from the begin that it is something about some missing setting. If somebody find something that works. (I guess something with stun or stun+ice), I'll create a wizard for that.</p>

<p>As for nimbuzz, the fact it works is absolutely not relevant : nimbuzz use a proprietary protocol between you and their server ! And then from nimbuzz server it ask the freephoneline.ca server for the call. As consequence it works just like if you configure pbxes.org to have a trunk with freephoneline.ca. So no direct connection and as consequence the fact it works is not relevant.</p>

<p>Usually in this case it's cause of the fact in 3G you are in a NATed network. As consequence as written in the FAQ, it could be useful to activate STUN. I don't know if freephoneline.ca has its own stun server but if so it could help to use their stun server.</p>

<p>@pshp... : You can also try to change rtp port. By default it is 4000 but these port are maybe blocked by your 3G provider. (It's in ExpertModeSettings in Network &gt; RTP port).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>That's an excellent news :).</p>

<p>I'm not sure to understand what they changed on their side to make it working but... if it works it's the most important :).</p>

<p>However as I'm not sure what they did on their side, it could be interesting if they can contact me to say what was wrong. As I'll possible change the CSipSimple user-agent to add more info (such as android version and device -- that's requested by some users). I'd prefer not to break they fix freephonline.ca did on their side.
However, as I'll not do this change soon, for now it's fine ;). (And anyway I think that I'll add an option to customize useragent when I'll implement it so that it will be easy to workaround)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>To make it quick the way to solve is to disable all codecs but one.
Go in Settings &gt; Media &gt; Codec
And long press on all codecs but only one (for example g729) and disable these codecs.
I would advise to activate only G711 for wideband tab and only g729 for narrowband tab.
Or you can leave activated only g729 for both tabs if you really want to use g729 even on wifi.</p>

<p>The important point is to leave <em>only</em> one codec activated.</p>

<h2>Copy of the reply I made to Ted to explain why you are getting that and how to solve.</h2>

<p>I think that I got it, there is a missing feature on freephoneline.ca that produce this apparent bug on csipsimple.
I'll try to explain what is happening :
First point to know is that pjsip (the sip stack on which csipsimple rely), only support one codec at a time when the call is established. The problem is that freephoneline.ca reply with several codecs (g711 and g729). It is absolutely valid regarding SIP RFC, and pjsip at this point is ok with that. The point, is that then, in order to fix only one codec for this call, pjsip send a re-invite/update in order to have only one codec (the one prefered in your list). So it send this re-invite/update and if freephoneline.ca server where working properly they should then only use one codec, the one selected by pjsip !
Instead it is buggy ! It still send with the other codec... So bug on the server side.
I asked to pjsip guys to try to support multiple codecs at a time which would avoid this reinvite and solve issue with this buggy servers. But sounds not so easy on their side. So, for now, the only solution is to disable all codec but the one you prefer. By the way on this server, it's not a big problem cause you know exactly what are supported codecs. So, you should try to disable all codecs but g729 in codec settings of csipsimple and you'll probably get two way audio.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Issue:
I have voice both ways on incoming and outgoing call, I can not hear the other party if I make an outgoing call on 3G/4G. However I have voice both ways on outgoing and incoming if I'm on WiFi, no issues on WiFi only if I'm using the data plan.</p>

<p>My setup:
- Android: Samsung Galaxy S2 running CyanogenMod 10.2 latest nightly
- Carrier : Telus
- SIP account from freephoneline.ca I paid the $50 fee to get the SIP settings</p>

<p>Tests:
- CSIPSimple latest version from Play Store with and without G729 codec installed ** issue remains **</p>

<ul>
<li><p>CSIPSimple CSipSimple-0.04-04-trunk.apk version that had G729 codec built-in ** issue remains **</p></li>
<li><p>Bria latest version from Play Store with G729 codec ** issue remains **</p></li>
<li><p>I also tried CSIPSimple and Bria apps with only G729 enabled ** issue remains **
then I only enabled G711u ** issue remains **</p></li>
<li><p>I have enabled STUN and ICE, STUN only and in both cases failed ** issue remains **</p></li>
<li><p>over WiFi I can see that the user agent on the freephoneline.ca SIP settings page is set to: 
CSipSimple_GT-I9100-18/r1788
however, over 3G/4G it is set to: 
SIPAUA/0.1.001 
based on Mahir's comment, the user agent part solved his issue, I'm wondering why it's being changed by simply switching from WiFi to 3G/4G? and is there a way to force it? I tried to set the user agent in CSIPSimple but that didn't seem to take effect. ** issue remains **</p></li>
<li><p>CSIPSimple worked on 3G/4G when I called my own phone number -the freephoneline number- to check voice mail, I was able to hear the answer machine, so incoming audio worked. The codec I used was G729</p></li>
<li><p>used the Fongo app and it worked over WiFi and 3G/4G! ** bit fishy since Fongo and freephoneline are essentially the same **</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm tired at this point to from all testing and I feel I have run out of testing cases to determine what's going on. Any help would be very much appreciated.</p></markdown-widget>
