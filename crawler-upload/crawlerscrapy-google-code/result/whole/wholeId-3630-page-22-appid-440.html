<p>After some study done for me I think that achieve better results if you can change this situation, since this problem and it does have some delay in communications.</p>

<p>In default 20ms ptime have failed to force to 10ms. I use two servers betamax clone in which there is some delay sometimes used both 3G and WiFi and wifi when I refer to speak at speeds of 300MB.</p>

<p>with another server but with calls much more expensive compared to betamax clones, listens very well and almost all calls people do not realize that we are connecting by ip but the server by pressing the i-call features 10ms ptime m that there is virtually no delay or interference on calls.</p>

<p>I wonder if you can force all servers registered in csipsimple use in 10ms ptime. Cause I doing it manually when I check the information during the call and always 20ms ptime</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>LG Optimus One rom 2.3.4 CM7 stable 6.5.5 and csipsimple lastest nightlies trunk gingerbread</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>You advise me to download in the trunk nightlies armeabi or gingerbread. I ask this because my LG P500 at the moment uses the gingerbread cyagonmed rom and not the official rom Lg CM7 seen with the best performance results.</p>

<p>I use the codec for all communications by both 3G and WiFi for GSM or G729 and always. But more often the GSM codec.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>It's in ExpertSettingMode (see the wiki page about that) and then Settings &gt; Media &gt; ptime.
By default as you noticed it's set to 20ms. 10ms should indeed be fine with many codecs. However it may consume more CPU and also maybe a bandwidth overhead (which can become significant). 
The good points are about packet loss cancellation and about latency. Bads are about CPU load and network load. 20ms is the default cause it's the default in pjsip. 
I never did advanced experiments on this parameter. </p>

<p>The only thing I noticed was that it would be interesting to have this option per network type (3G vs Wifi), like it's done for codecs.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>About the native gingerbread SIP implementation, you should try in CSipSimple to change the audio settings. By default, (because most SIP manufacturer has just drop sip support in android 2.3), I disable the audio settings that are actually made for SIP calls.</p>

<p>You can manually re-activate these settings. (In expert setting mode) Settings &gt; media &gt; 
 * mode for sip calls - choose IN_COMMUNICATION
 * micro source - choose COMMUNICATION.</p>

<p>These modes are known to try to enable the hardware echo canceller and put the audio driver in the state optimized for voice over IP calls.</p>

<p>I know that Cyanogen mods are very well implemented on this point and do respect what is in the Android OpenSource Project code. That's not the case of all manufacturer - and that's why it's disabled by default in CSipSimple.</p>

<p>So changing that you should have an implementation really closed to the stock SIP application. I did advanced tests about that and CSipSimple use same settings it's even a little bit better than the stock app because they rely on a less performant SIP stack.
And besides they use something similar to what is implemented in trunk, they even didn't try to implement things by the new way I do in the gingerbread branch, which performance should not differe a lot cause as I said, no implementation (AFAIK) bind the new audio layer (OpenSL-ES) directly to the driver. </p>

<p>The important improvement in android 2.3 implementations is about the way the audio is opened when doing voice over IP. And this can be configured with audio mode and mic source. </p>

<p>What I call gingerbread in the gingerbread branch is something really different that may not have impact for now with known android implementations. It's about how audio frames are read/write to the audio driver, not about the way this one is open.</p>

<p>The source code of the stock sip application is available on android git that's why I can tell exactly what they do ;). However IN_COMMUNICATION mode and COMMUNICATION mic source are private api until android 3.0, that's why many manufacturers dropped the support of SIP and did crappy audio driver when they updated their devices to 2.3.</p></markdown-widget>

Using csipsimple with the settings you just show me, (expert mode configuration) settings&gt; media&gt; * mode for SIP calls - choose IN_COMMUNICATION micro source * - choose COMMUNICATION. These modes are known to try to enable the echo canceller hardware and put the audio driver in optimal state for voice over IP. But the media menu for this configuration to work properly I have to work well. For example I have to enable or disable echo cancellation, the audio voice detection, queuing and Focus audio IO.</p>

<p>I would appreciate your opinion to try for my csipsimple with better quality than the native 2.3 sip as I told you before them and the quality good but no one can program fazas codec and whenever a call always call sign is not even indeed such a person can take the phone off or out of coverage not in that statement.</p></markdown-widget>
