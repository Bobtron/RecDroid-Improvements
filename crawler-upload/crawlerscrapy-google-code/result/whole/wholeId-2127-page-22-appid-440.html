The RFC for this codec is very recent and the RFC for RTP/SDP on this codec has changed very recently which make the current implementation of the codec hard to maintain. I just spend 3 hours of my evening to debug something that changed in recent versions of the RFC.
Besides, few other clients and server currently supports opus.
Last point, many servers will remain with speex. 
So :
- definitely we will not remove speex from the package in next coming years.
- we will consider adding opus in the core version (instead of the current plugin way to get it) when 
    * all RFC about this codec will be final 
    * no bug will be known in the current implementation (might be the case since 3 minutes due to the last commit)
    * works with other sip client/server implem of the codec (I still took a shortcut in implem that apparently other implementors took too, but if one starts using different approach might break current implem)
    * previous point covers more than 2 other projects supporting this codec (currently I know only freeswitch and jitsi that have opus support).</p>

<p>Until these points are reached, you can still download the codec pack that provides the codec plugin (get this from nightly build website and get last version of both plugin and the app to get latest fixes on this point)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Regarding to SIP switches, supporting those codecs, FreeSWITCH just has ceased support for speex and removed speex module from its common builds:
<a href="https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Speex">https://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Speex</a>
I've noticed that, because I used speex earlier, and now I have to remove it from both FS and CSS configurations...</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Wahoou, I was not aware FS replaced speex in flavor to opus. Thx for sharing this page, it's good to know.</p>

<p>Dropping speex in the absolute why not... but opus is not yet totally standard and cannot be really considered as a replacement. For me opus would be more the replacement of silk codec.
The opus codec itself is a standard. There is an RFC that explains the codec format itself (the rfc6716). So a bitstream file with opus inside is a standard.
However having the codec format a standard is not the only thing a voip/streaming app needs to transmit this codec over the network. We also need the RTP payload specification. And as far as I know (and seems to be confirmed by what I can currently read in opusFAQ), the RFC about opus payload for RTP is still a draft : 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-spittka-payload-rtp-opus">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-spittka-payload-rtp-opus</a> (it's currently version 3).</p>

<p>And for each version of the draft I had changes to do inside csipsimple. And I guess FS guys had to do the same unless they started to work on this topic only after last june. On my side I started before version 0 with some wrong assumption on what could be the result of this RFC ;).</p>

<p>So I find their choice very weird and risky unless they have a roadmap and that the version that drop something to replace it with opus is some kind a nightly build and that it will land when the RFC about RTP payload will be final (and in this case they have an information that I do not have which is the date of the final release of this RFC draft).</p>

<p>But that's my personal point of view, and I can understand that a server application has not same constraints than a client one. On client side we take more the pressure on trying to support all existing servers so that all users whatever the server they trying to connect get something working. On server side they can choose less codecs and request clients to support it. Moreover, target of server software setup is more "geek" persons, and it's less a problem for these people to install a module. FS works a lot with mods which is a very good approach I think and that I would love to use more on csipsimple but I'm constrained with the fact most users wants things to work immediately at first install.</p>

<p>That's said, even taking this difference in consideration, I still find that a little bit risky to announce opus as something "stable" on their releases already. It's kind of things that resulted in far past to web-browser de-facto standard (internet explorer was a specialist)... and they now learned from this mistake and prefix all "not-yet-final" standard in their browser release and unprefix things only when the standard is fully final (was for example a very good idea for css3 gradient that evolved a lot).</p></markdown-widget>
