                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  I tested beta and can report the following:</p>

<p>1) The good news is that vCardIO beta does tag the newly imported records in the 
selected group.</p>

<p>2) A major problem for me, which may be a Google bug not yours, is that although I 
load these contacts into a group that has been deselected for sync in the main 
Contacts app, the contacts sync anyway and upload to Google Gmail Contacts.  That is 
the exact behaviour I am trying to avoid.</p>

<p>I tried several combinations, including first going to Settings and disabling 
Contacts sync entirely before running the vCardIO import.  (That might speed things 
up anyway.)  But after the import, when I toggle that global setting back on, the 
contacts in the group upload to Google.  In all these cases, the group remained 
deselected for sync in the main Contacts app menu.</p>

<p>3) Another issue for me is that if all the above worked as intended, I still would 
need the ability (on the phone, not Google) to globally delete all contacts in a 
selected group before I reload the batch of vCard records.  This would cover deletes 
that not longer exist in my master.</p>

<p>4) A minor annoyance in the vCardIO interface, when the physical keyboard is enabled 
in horizontal mode, the user cannot scroll down to select the contact groups before 
the import.  The workaround is to close the keyboard and scroll in vertical mode.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Great app!  However, the behavior listed by boomerbubba's comment 5 at #2 is
precisely what I'm encountering.  I am using an HTC Hero with newest beta version of
vcardio, and I have an additional major import issue that I'm running into as well. 
Both are below.</p>

<p>Problem One: Pictures
1) I exported the contacts to my SD card minutes ago, using the latest beta of vcardio
2) I deleted all my contacts (ouch!)
3) I tried to import my contacts, but it failed on a picture</p>

<p>I know this is the case because a contact was imported without a picture, therefore
the picture (which was not imported) is very likely the issue.  The curious thing is
that I used your program to export it, so the encoding should be acceptable to
vcardio, right?</p>

<p>Pictures aren't critical, but importing is.  I was pretty excited to see that the
pictures were exportable and importable -- that rocks.  If it can do the picture,
great.  Some worked.  But if the code could gracefully fail by skipping the bad
images, and continuing with the rest of the import, that would be slick.</p>

<p>Problem Two: Contact Groups not Supported
1) The import of any contact on the HTC Hero wants to add the contact as a "Google"
contact by default
2) On my phone, I manually created a contact that was a "Phone" contact, and a
contact that was a "Google" contact
3) However, when I export these contacts using vcardio, they are identical in that
there is no type specified for either -- the words "Google" and "Phone" are not
present, nor is any other identifying information</p>

<p>So the deeper issue of how the underlying contact information is pulled from Android
is the issue:  How can the program determine which contacts are "Google" and which
are "Phone" type?  And how can this information be stored in VCF format to allow it
to be imported?</p>

<p>We realize that this may not be possible for vcardio to achieve, and may be related
to Android, either by defect or design.  It is defective design in that you can't
edit the contact type once a contact has been saved, but we're trying to work around
this by export/import.</p></markdown-widget>

multiple groups at the same time (vCardIO will add imported contacts to <em>all</em> the
checked groups --- make sure the group "Contacts" is not checked). If that isn't the
problem, I'm not sure what I can do -- the sync settings are not well documented
(some aren't at all).</p>

<p>@postmaster5000: could you send me (or attach) the file that failed to import? I
agree that failing on a contact should be done gracefully -- I'll try to see what
went wrong.</p>

<p>As for your second problem --- I'm not sure what you mean by a "Google" vs "Phone"
contact. I don't have a Hero; could it be using a group scheme that's different from
the stock "cupcake" or "donut"? If you can send me or attach a copy of your
"contacts.db" database, that would be very helpful (you'll need a rooted phone for
this -- the database is in
/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts/databases/contacts.db).</p></markdown-widget>

Problem Two.</p>

<p>On HTC Hero contacts have 2 distinct attributes: 
-   contact_type with 3 possible values: ["Google","Phone","SIM"] and 
-   contact_group : list with all the groups where the contact belongs</p>

<p>If I define manually a contact, I can set contact_type = "Google" or "Phone", but if
I export them in .vcf (using vcardio) and the reimport, it became automatically as
"Google"</p>

Adrian</p></markdown-widget>

vcardio on my Hero, adding or removing photos for each contact has become extremely
unreliable.  For example, I am completely unable to remove a particular contact's
photo now -- it is always present, no matter what I try.  This is either a result of
differences with the Hero's contact storage (or image storage), or the Hero itself
(and nothing at all to do with vcardio).  Or maybe it has something to do with the
fact that I had to manually edit my .VCF file and remove all the PHOTO... data so
that I could get my contact list imported (since images were causing crashes).</p>

<p>To make things even more exciting, I am unaware of a way to root a Sprint Hero, and
am therefore unable to access the contacts.db file, so I'm of little help here.</p></markdown-widget>

with photo importing were fixed in donut (1.6). I'm not sure what the status is for
the Hero. Also, when you say the import "failed", do you mean it "forced close"? In
any case, it would be helpful if you could attach a VCF file that fails.</p>

I've just one picture in my vcf (from OSX) and it was precisely in the contact where
the import stopped (force close). The import works fine without the picture.</p>

<p>BUT
I also can't import all my (650) vcards in one step (force close). I selected all
from A-F (134 contacts) and that worked (the picture mentioned above was in this
subset and I deleted it in a text editor when the first try failed).
Maybe it has something to do with file sizes?</p>

<p>Especially for Mac users vcardIO is very valuable workaround, at least untill serious
syncing with the Mac (as with all other phones) will be available! I will now try the
new beta.</p>
