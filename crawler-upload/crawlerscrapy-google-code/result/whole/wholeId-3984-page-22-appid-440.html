                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. open csipsimple
2. make a call
3. the app sometimes will not switch to the active calls screen, instead you will just hear the audio from the call but the dialpad is still showing.  Now even if you exit the app, the audio is still playing.  There is no way to stop it or hang up the call!  If you re-launch csipsimple, it complains that some app is already using the SIP port.  Only solution is to power off the device.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
nightly build r723, using HTC Thunderbolt (verizon) running Android 2.2</p>

<p>Also affected r700, 705 when tested on Moto Citrus.  I thought at first maybe it was because of Android 2.1 and slow cpu on that device, but the bug has persisted onto this new relatively hi-end phone.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>It sounds the choosen codec is G722 for your calls. Problem is that what is sent by the server seems not to be G722. 
In fact, the server you use reply with multiple codecs. Unfortunately, pjsip does not like that. It only allow to choose one codec and then talk with this codec. As consequence pjsip resend an invite by choosing only g722 but your server on the other side ignore that and talk using another codec. As consequence pjsip is lost. (You'll probably experiment ANR and no sound at all).
Usually server that send replies with multiple codecs do that cause your are now in call with an auto attendee. (automatic machine such as voice mail and so on, support multiple codecs in reception but only send using one codec).
So it could be interesting to disable g722 and only test with for example pcmu.</p>

<p>I'll have more closer look cause there is also interesting point about how I manage network changes.</p>

<p>I'll keep you in touch</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi thank you so much for taking the time to look at this.  To give you some more infos:  I am connecting to a local asterisk server here on my LAN.  The extension (704) for my android phone is configured to only allow g722&amp;ulaw. (I had g729 enabled before but I have turned it off now).  As far as I know the way SIP basically  works is that whoever sends the INVITE first (which will be CSipSimple in this case if he is making the call) should advertise which codecs he supports in the SDP.  So  pjsip should say "hi, I would like to make a call, you can reach me on IP 11.22.33.44 and I can talk g722,ulaw,etc etc.  Then it should wait for the proxy or asterisk server to respond with the rest of the instructions (where to send media, which codecs the other side supports etc) and then pjsip can select the "best" one that they both support and start sending media.  So even if asterisk supports g722,pcmu,g729,pcma etc, it should still be able to negotiate a match, no?  maybe I misunderstand the way it works.</p>

<p>P.S.- nightly builds site seems down?  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/trunk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/trunk</a> give me a 404.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>As for the nightly build website, that's fixed now. I was trying to fix www.csipsimple.com and csipsimple.com but I broke nightlies.csipsimple.com while doing that lol. You'll probably have to clear your browsing cache. Else it will probably try to redirect again and again to code.google.com... or if you don't want to remove your browsing history just go to <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/?a=o">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/?a=o</a> (a=o param will fake the browser so that it will try to reload without using its cache ;) ).</p>

<p>For the SIP process the standard echange is should be like that :</p>

<ul>
<li>CSipSimple INVITE sending SDP (SDP contains supported codecs)</li>
<li>The other side after optional 100 trying and 180 ringing send a 200 OK with a SDP containing chosen codec.</li>
<li>Communication is established based on the chosen codec by the other side.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem here is that in the 200 OK from the asterisk contains the list of supported codec. So after the 200 OK, while call is 'established' &lt;&gt; codec is still not choosen. As far as I know this is not forbidden by SIP RFCs. However it annoy pjsip cause they do not support multiple codecs at the same time.
As consequence, pjsip re-send invite with only one codec. As the other side announce it support all this codecs, pjsip decide to choose only g722 in our case. However your server seems to ignore this reinvite with only one codec and send to pjsip RTP packets encoded with one of the other codecs of the first invite (I guess that's using pcmu). Problem is that at this point, pjsip expect only g722 RTP packets (or telephony events RTP packets). 
So then you asterisk thinks it can talk using "any of it" the announced codec in first INVITE while pjsip expect only g722 (since it has explicitly asked for it in re-invite).</p>

<p>I'm not an expert at asterisk configuration but hopefully there is a way to workaround that on the server side to either allow re-invite or to choose definitely a codec when replying invite and then transcode codec if needed.</p>

<p>So in your scenario there is two problems, one on pjsip and one on the server :
On pjsip side it could be cool to support multiple codecs. For reference the issue in pjsip : <a href="http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/476">http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/476</a> -- it was marked as fixed time ago cause at pjsip side they consider sending re-INVITE from pjsip to force only one codec should fix it.
On asterisk : it probably does not actually take into account the re-INVITE codec change. However what's strange is that asterisk seems to acknowledge the re-INVITE and to correctly consider the G722 as only codec. But regarding logs about bad RTP format it seems to actually continue to send using another codec.</p></markdown-widget>
