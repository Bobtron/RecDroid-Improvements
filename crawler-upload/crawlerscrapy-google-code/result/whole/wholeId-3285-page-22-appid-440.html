<hr>

<p>Please please please create a gorgeous toggle widget for the homescreen which allows to easily switch between the different settings
-- always available
[-- available in WLAN environments]
-- only for outgoing calls</p>

<p>I am referring to this FAQ issue:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ?tm=6#Is_there_a_way_to_close_the_application">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ?tm=6#Is_there_a_way_to_close_the_application</a>?</p>

<p>It would be much more convenient to be able to turn on/off CSipSimple by simply having to tap on the screen -- rather than opening the app, going to the settings and change the configuration (which I have to do several times a day, the WLAN-option is not enough for me, at home I do not want to use it in my WLAN-environment, at work, at my parents' etc. I do want to use it in WLAN-environments).</p>

<p>Such a "simple" widget would be marvellous.</p>

<p>Thanks for this great app!</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hello and thank you for your superquick reply!!</p>

<p>Reading <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=871">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=871</a> showed me that I am actually talking about something that already exists -- in part.</p>

<p>I am not exactly looking for a different application which allows to monitor all sorts of things automatically.</p>

<p>I would simply like to be able to manually "switch on/off" CSipSimple (in layman-terms). I think I referred to the wrong feature. It would be enough for me if I was able to activate and deactivate all accounts (or preferably a number of selected accounts) in one click.</p>

<p>I can do what I want by having six CSipSimple HomeScreenWidgets for all my accounts. These widgets allow to activate / deactive each of them individually.
What I would like to have is ONE such widget which activates / deactivates ALL (or ideally, a selected number of accounts) in one click.</p>

<p>So, the only thing that would need to be added is a multiselect-option, which allows to select not just one but several accounts when you add the homescreen widget, which is already part of the app.</p>

<p>This would be perfect and should not be too hard to implement, I think, as the feature is already there basically.</p>

<p>Sorry for being unclear.</p>

<p>BTW1: A workaround for me would be to use PBXes to manage all my accounts and have just the PBXes account registered in CSipSimple, which I can then activated and deactivate with one homescreen widget. However, then it gets much more complicated to select the outgoing provider when making a SIP-call.</p>

<p>BTW2 (off-topic): I cannot find this "disconnect"-button when I have changed the settings to "Only for outgoing calls". I am using the German version. All I have is the "exit-button", which is there in all three possible settings. Where should the disconnect-button be? Could you post a screenshot perhaps?</p>

<p>Thanks again!
CSipSimple is simply great!</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Yes, in fact I often talked about the automated thing of the new app, but it can also be used as a basic switcher for settings : In fact one of the possible condition is a force on/off widget on home screen.
So possibility are really endless with this approach. While doing single features in csipsimple is also endless but for only one feature on the other side (sip). So better to have something more generic I think.</p>

<p>In fact I already use this app to do so. There is some automatic feature (that switch between my company and my public personal sip account). This is done based on network. And there is also another one that I use to switch to development mode and that force activate a group of account and deactive another one.</p>

<p>I know that what you ask is not so difficult to implement, but if I do that inside csipsimple, it will just be a little part of what could be done and there is <em>a lot</em> of little things that could be done easily.
My point is that :
 * It make more complex the sip app, that should be just about sip
 * It should be done by a dedicated app, that will allows to do much more things. For example activating/deactivating more complex settings. Activating/deactivating the always available or only for outgoing feature and so on.</p>

<p>About your workaround 1; indeed it's a good solution. Besides keep in mind that as many account you have, as fast you'll drain the battery of your phone. Each account try to keep a connection with its own server. And some server are very verbose. Even if pbxes.org is sometimes very buggy, they tried to optimize things for mobile.</p>

<p>About point 2 : to get the disconnect button. Go in dialer screen of csipsimple, press menu key of your phone (it's a physical button usually or sensitive one). The last entry is the disconnect option (the icon should be enough to find it :) ).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hello!</p>

<p>Okay, point 2: the German translation of this button is more like "exit" than like "disconnect" and the button is there in all settings. So I was confused.</p>

<p>I don't agree that it is better to have an additional powerful app, which could do lots of things that you don't need, if there is a very simple solution. Each additional app drains the battery, uses memory etc.</p>

<p>I do understand, though, that there are lots of "little" things that cannot be implemented.</p>

<p>I don't see however how the multiselection option should make the sip app more complicated as the select option is there already (so the feature in fact IS there already). </p>

<p>I think it is the additional app that makes everything much more complicated -- even though it obviously offers an enormous range of additional benefits.
Simply activating/deactivating CSipSimple when (not) needed can be done by any user. Setting configurations based on networks etc. is much more complicated, and not every user might be capable or willing to try it.</p>

<p>I sill think that it would be very useful to have the multiselection option for the (de)activation widget and I'd like to ask you again to think about it (even though you are obviously very fond of the additional app, which is great, I am sure!).</p>

<p>I would be so happy to have NO additional app but a more general widget. It would make using CSipSimple much easier for me.
And as in many many apps (e.g. email apps), there is a multiselection option, most users will be familiar with it and have no problems at all, but might profit from it and find it very useful...</p>

<p>I greatly appreciate you thinking about it again!
Thanks so much! </p></markdown-widget>
