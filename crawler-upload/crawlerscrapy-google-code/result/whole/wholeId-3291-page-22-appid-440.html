                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi Luke,</p>

<p>This kind of problem is often obtained when the route is not maintained by the sip server.</p>

<p>In fact, in sip once the remote sip side has been found by the registrar server, the sip signal can pass directly as a peer to peer signal.
This is the case of the "confirm" signal sent by the application when it wants to confirm that the communication has been established. The remote side should send a "ack" in this case that the communication has been established. From this point the application change the background from grey to green.</p>

<p>I think that in your case the remote side ip can't be accessed from the mobile. In consequence it sends the confirm to the remote side, but the remote side never replies the "ack". As consequence, as specified in sip protocol, the application will consider that the remote side is dead. And will close the connection after 30 sec if no replies.</p>

<p>My guess is that is what you get.</p>

<p>Then how to solve the problem? 
Well, usually that's about configuration. It could be because of the fact the server is not really fine with NATed topology or because the configuration of the server on csipsimple does not match what is expected by the server.</p>

<p>Anyway, what could be helpful to start to understand where to look at is to collect some logs. See HowToCollectLogs wiki page and send me the logs you get when you place an outgoing call.
Also if you can indicate me how you configured the account : basic wizard, advanced wizard, expert wizard?, did you entered a sip proxy -- this could particularily help in your case -- ? Did you activated the stun or ice options (this usually helps to getting voice path, but could also sometimes help with communication signalization)</p>

<p>Also if your pc softphone is able to collect logs it could be interesting to compare with their settings.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Thank you very much for your quick response. I replicated the problem by performing a clean install. I have tried many combinations before but the configurations which I changed are as follows:</p>

<p>Changed setting to available on wifi
Add basic account
Added all settings</p>

<p>In settings/Network
Enabled ICE and Stun (stun.counterpath.com
Unchecked use other networks for incoming and outgoing</p>

<p>The wizard added a SIP proxy automatically. </p>

<p>I have also attached a log file as requested. I'm sorry, I may have emailed it to you before under a different name just now from the app.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>Thanks again for everything.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>What happens if you remove the proxy from expert account mode?</p>

<p>Indeed it adds the proxy with the same than the registrar because most sip server are both sip registrar and sip proxy, and in this case it's better to use the server as proxy for the account.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well, thanks to topcat logs, we were able to find the root cause (at least of his issue)</p>

<p>The following is a little bit technical -- it's just for me and for the record ---</p>

<p>It seems that the SIP server used in this case, reply the ACK with lower case tag. This is not a good idea from server because it leads to be incompatible with some sip client implementation that compares and check with case sensitivity. And it's the case of pjsip stack.</p>

<p>However, here seems that regarding the RFC this should be possible (cf <a href="https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/pipermail/sip-implementors/2005-August/009972.html">https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/pipermail/sip-implementors/2005-August/009972.html</a> ). So it seems to be something to fix in the SIP stack for robustness even if the idea of the sip server (in this case Sippy) to transform the tag is not very good.</p>

<p>I was able to produce a build that doesn't have the problem by generating only lower case tag and was tested by topcat. However not suitable for production fix. So I asked to pjsip maintainers what would be a correct fix for that (and if should be fixed or not... maybe the statement in the RFC is obsolete per another RFC or maybe there is a good reason to not compare case insensitive).</p>

<p>Depending on the reply we will have a fix or an argument to send to SIP provider to not transform case of the tag. (if needed I'll directly contact sippy developers so that the fix is done at the root thing that produce this case change). </p></markdown-widget>

The server (for some reason), doesn't accept the re-invite that tries to fixes the codec.
And instead of ignoring it ... the server hangup with a BYE "Protocol error, unspecified"</p>

<p>It's a problem on server side that doesn't support correclty what's made by the application to select the codec.</p>

<p>A workaround would be to enable only one codec in the application settings (so that no re-invite will be needed to fix the codec). To do so, go in settings &gt; media &gt; codecs and deselect all but one codec.
Regarding the reply of the server, my advise on the codec you should select :
If you are over wifi use PCMU as the only codec (in fast network tab). If over 3G use only GSM as the only codec (in slow network tab).</p></markdown-widget>

thanks a lot for the quick reply.
I've tried to enable only one codec, got the same disconnect.
I forgot to mention, this happens on 4g/3g only.
When i'm on wifi -- everything works fine.
So it might be mobile data network related issue.
I've already contacted sip-provider, will see if they can advise any workarounds/solutions.
Anyway, if you still have time, here is the app log while using PCMU 8k and GSM 8k codecs:
