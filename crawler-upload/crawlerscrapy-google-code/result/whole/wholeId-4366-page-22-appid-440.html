                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Create an account with voceonline.romtelecom.ro (it's free)
2. Login to the web dialer at <a href="https://voceonline.romtelecom.ro/flashlogin/index.php">https://voceonline.romtelecom.ro/flashlogin/index.php</a> and click on Options (the "wheel" logo) and then on SIP to see the SIP access data (different from the account created in step #1)
3. Configure the SIP account in CSipSimple and try to log in</p>

<p>What is the expected output? Stable connection to the provider's network, ability to make SIP calls.
What do you see instead? Registration failures about 50% of the time. When successful, registration takes a lot of time (around one minute) and the connection seems to drop without warning (with the phone sitting on the desk, one meter from the WiFi router). The same account registers swiftly when using other SIP clients (Fring, Sipdroid, Nimbuzz).
After registration, it's impossible to make any actual calls. I've tried making calls to Romtelecom (Romania main landline provider) numbers without success; the same account works fine with other clients (tested with Fring and Sipdroid, same issue with Nimbuzz). </p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
I've been facing the same behavior on 00-15-18, 00-15-17 and the Market version (I believe it's 00-15). Phone/OS information: Android 2.2 running on HTC Desire, custom ROM (LeeDroid 2.2d, widely regarded by the XDA community as the most stable Sense ROM for the HTC Desire)</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
Let me know if there are any additional steps I can take to help with the troubleshooting - log collection, debug level setting etc. </p></markdown-widget>

<p>I'll check if your server support SIP RFC (if not maybe it will maybe consider multiple registrations).</p>

<p>Also ... check that STUN is correctly activated in settings (it's not activated by default, cause in some countries prevent from registering if I use generic STUN servers).
You may also use the STUN server provided in the configuration panel. Can be only better with your provider stun server :)</p></markdown-widget>

Just wondering, are you running into the same problems with your Romtelecom

<p>I've just taken down 00.15-18 and reverted to the 15-17, removed the

<p>You should not disable TCP in Network settings (TCP can still be useful for other stuff or other accounts if you have). You have to change the transport to UDP in the account. Auto in your case is not valid.  If you keep Auto and disable TCP, the sip stack will have a packet to send through TCP (cause to big) and have no transport to send it. 
So in your case : keep TCP and UDP transport enabled. and in account setting instead of Transport "Auto", choose transport "UDP".</p>

<p>Also try to use 00.15-18 that may help for Hung up. (But I think that in this case it's also linked to the transport "auto" setting in account settings).</p></markdown-widget>

your wifi router seems to be not really friendly with default ports I use.
You could try to change RTP start port range to 61000 (instead of 40000 which is the default).
Besides if you can also change local UDP port change to something higher that 5060 (BTW, we will be sure that there is no other apps on your phone that steal the port).</p>

<p>I'll continue to have a look to logs, but first approach it seems that we have no response from the server at all while packets are correctly sent.</p>

<p>Is there a firewall on your wifi network router?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>There is indeed a firewall on the router, but other applications appear to be working fine.
I've updated the local UDP port from 5060 to 10120 (2x5060 to make it easier to remember) and the RTP from 4000 to 61000. 
Registration was stable since the last disconnection and re-registration (after changing the ports) was quick.
I've then enabled logging and disconnected the account, then restarted the program - registration failed ever since, it doesn't make any sense to me.</p>

<p>Not sure it's related, I also saw these in the logcat:
  16:06:34.313 stuntsx0x2791a  STUN timeout waiting for response</p>

<p>15:47:06.151 sip_transport.  Error processing 62 bytes packet from UDP 58.187.66.154:10061 : PJSIP syntax error exception when parsing '' header on line 1 col 3:

 -- end of packet. -- end of packet.</p>

<p>It finally registered after a few minutes of trying, but I still can't make any calls. </p></markdown-widget>
