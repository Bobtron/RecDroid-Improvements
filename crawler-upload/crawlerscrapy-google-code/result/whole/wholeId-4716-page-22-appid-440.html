There is an app called 'Shake2PlayNext' that can change the playing music on a number of players by sending a command that tells the phone the 'Next' media button was pushed from the headset (if I understand it correctly). Maybe on an incoming call, the same trick can be used to tell it to pause the music. I think this would stop the music, but would still allow Navigation to work. </p></markdown-widget>

<p>The problem is that on some devices it seems to introduce problems. It was maybe linked to the combined use of another method and should be tested again.</p>

(see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/trunk/CSipSimple/src/com/csipsimple/service/UAStateReceiver.java#483">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/trunk/CSipSimple/src/com/csipsimple/service/UAStateReceiver.java#483</a>)</p>

<p>It can explains your issues with this latest version :
* The fact the stream doesn't come back to not solo mode
* The fact that you stay whith the SCREEN_DIM lock active.</p>

<p>So, I would be really interested if you can send me some traces using logcat.</p>

<p>Besides, I've just made a new build :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-02.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-02.apk</a> 
If you are already using -12-01, reinstall is not needed.</p>

<p>There is several minor improvements in this one ( custom screen lock while in call, the disable codec feature on long clic on a codec ).</p>

<p>For the initial issue of this thread, I think that using streamsolo is the best and cleaner way to solve the issue. 
But in addition of this solution, it's possible that in the future I look in the android MusicPlayer API to see what are the command to pause music. It will probably work only for the official music player but it's a cool feature.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As to pausing the player, do you think that this is the right interface for the job?
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#requestAudioFocus%28android.media.AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener,%20int,%20int%29">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#requestAudioFocus%28android.media.AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener,%20int,%20int%29</a>
Looks like (any sensible) audio player is supposed to register an onAudioFocusChange callback and if someone requests AUDIO_FOCUS, pause itself. If the theory is true, then all you need to do is requestAudioFocus(..., ..., AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN) and all other players will be advised to pause. Which they hopefully will do. After the call completes, abandonAudioFocus(...).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For example it can be use by a GPS turn by turn applications that don't want to stop music but talk louder than music during a couple of seconds.</p>

<p>In the case of SIP application, I think is that music should be paused or at least totally muted (that's the current behavior since I added the streamSolo feature). </p>

<p>But this can be done only using an undocumented API from the Music application. 
The android Music application is opensource (I recently contributed one line of code to this application in the android git :D ). So, it's quietly easy to find the private APIs. In fact it is probably undocumented private intents and these intents probably allow other apps to play/pause/stop music.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Thanks a lot for the logcat !</p>

<p>Seems the unsetAudio method well invoked but the setAudio is called twice. It can be the cause of our issues. </p>

<p>Just for my information, do you reproduce the screen lock issue with this version? </p>

<p>I added a test to lock only if not yet locked.
As SIP calls with an Asterisk server seems to make setAudio be called twice, it's really possible that previous version acquired the screenLock twice but released it only one time. 
This version (12-02) should acquire the lock only one time. So hopefully release of the lock do his job now.</p>

<p>Besides the documentation specify that setStreamSolo calls are cumulative. So if called twice and unSolo only once... :). I should probably test force setAudio to be done only once. (Or at least setStreamSolo and wake locks).</p>

<p>P.S. : I've removed the logcat file from your comment : it's better to not let theses things be referenced by google - it contains your IPs addresses and your sip address.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Now pause the android Music application while in call. And then when sip call is finished, the android Music application is asked to continue to play.
The only annoying thing is that, as I supposed, other music application doesn't handle properly theses intents.</p>

<p>For example with the really nice cube media player it doesn't work at all and when call is finished, android music application start to play while was not playing and cube continues to play his track that was never stopped.
To solve this issue I'll add an option to disable android music player integration. But feature is nice :).</p>

<p>This revision also include a refactoring of how audio his tear up/down. Seems it improves things for many device but not enough stable yet :(</p></markdown-widget>

<p>yes the icon is there. Now that I rechecked it, I realized that the player was not paused when I answered the call, but only muted. Which BTW I think should happen right when the ringtone starts, too.</p>

<p>No, HTC music player. (And, it <em>is</em> paused by mobile calls). I think that I don't have Android player at all on my device.</p>

<p>On a second thought, it is <em>possible</em> (not checked!) that in 2.2 the HTC player no longer listens for ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED events, and instead relies on the new AUDIOFOCUS interface. Presumably, standard phone application uses it too so they cooperate properly.</p></markdown-widget>

But don't worry I'm really confident with backward compatibility stuff ;). 
There is already a lot of things in CSipSimple that use different levels of API and fallback to degraded feature when running on 1.5 (for example tab bar on 1.5 doesn't look like the same ;) ).
There is two techniques to do so. Both are well described in the android blog : 
<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/04/backward-compatibility-for-android.html">http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/04/backward-compatibility-for-android.html</a>
If you are interested to have the full view of both method that can be used.</p>

<p>The only thing I risk is forget to check when I use a method whether it is available in android 1.5 ;). But if so, users will immediately report it since app will directly force close at loading time ! </p>

<p>For this issue, I've something functional. Need to commit and build it. (It will be in next dev release, but I'll try to not forget to update this issue when it will be released).</p></markdown-widget>

In fact, audio focus announce that it is a "transient" gain (see : <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT</a>) . Regarding code of the official music app, if the focus gain is is transient, then it will restart playing : They save the loss type as flag that is used to know if restart should be done after the focus is gain again.
As I use this type of audiofocus, I should be restarted after... unless music audio manager receiver is freed (can be the case if android ask for RAM memory - or because of a bug in the HTC Music app).
It could explain what you observe. Maybe in csipsimple you'll get the same random behavior than the one you have for mobile calls. The only way to be sure would be to have the HTC music app source code :).</p></markdown-widget>
