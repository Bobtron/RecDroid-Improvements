<p>The main thing I notice that's different is the codec selection.  Previously my calls used either PCMU/PCMA 8KHz and now they all seem to be using GSM, even though I disabled it in the codec list (both narrow and wideband lists, but only wide is relevant since all calls are over wifi).  It seems the codec list setting has no effect on the codec that actually gets used.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is only a codec selection problem or if something else is causing audio problems - I would have thought this phone could handle the GSM codec but even with the CPU clock at 633MHz it dies on r590 (audio clock rate set to 8KHz).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>r593 should fix problem with codec choice.</p>

<p>Also if you reinstalled the app, remember that by default echo cancellation is turned on, which could be deeply impact CPU. So worth to try to disable it.</p>

<p>I've just tried on a i5800 and with echo cancellation on it's awful while pretty good with echo cancellation off. (I should probably try to detect CPU power before choosing if echo cancellation and echo algorithm is chosen).</p></markdown-widget>

In fact there were still some old "key" remaining somewhere that was referring the old preferences (with only one codec list) and with a fresh install this old key does not exists and as consequence the entire priority (and disabled) codecs where broken.</p>

<p>Regarding my tests on the i5800 I think that I'll change the default value for echo cancellation from true if android os &gt;=1.6 to true if &gt;=1.6 and cpu armeabi &gt; v7a (which exclude i5800... don't know for widfire, I'll check on google what is the cpu abi of widefire ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Just did some simple tests with the ekiga echo test number  and PCMU.  Disabling echo cancellation makes a huge difference in CPU use: with it enabled, the csipsimple process runs at 50-55% CPU, and with it disabled, it runs at 15-25% CPU.  Even increasing the audio clock rate from 8KHz to 16KHz only adds about 5% average CPU.</p>

<p>Also, although calling the echo-tester isn't conclusive, it seems like call quality is actually better without the echo cancellation.  There is a bit more echo with it turned off, but with it enabled there's a nasty "screech" audio artifact that happens when you start speaking or say something suddenly at a higher volume.  This seemed to be the same with both the default "simple" and the "speex" algorithm.</p>

<p>With the questionable impact on quality and the major impact on CPU, I think I agree with disabling it by default.  :)  I will do some more testing though.</p></markdown-widget>

It confirms what I observe on the i5800. As both are armv6 processor it is probably the good criteria to turn echo cancellation on or off. 
I've to check if FLOATING_POINT is correctly disabled with build for amrv6. Cause this kind of CPU does not support it and in pjsip there is a way to tell that and to build it in consequence. 
As there is two builds, one for armeabi (v5/6) and armeabi-v7a, the one with eabi should be built with FLOATING POINT support disabled. Cause I'm a little bit desappointed with the fact we could not activate echo canceller on armv6 devices... we should be able to do so, pjsip builds on symbian and on other device with lower CPU and I think that in this case echo cancellation is fine too. So there is probably some setting in pjsip to change to have it working... I'll investigate </p></markdown-widget>

<p>Have a look here : <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Platforms/Android">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Platforms/Android</a> =&gt; it's armv6. However does not necessarily mean that it does not support in the absolute vfp. In android NDK, they disabled it for armv6 and lower. I guess they have a very good reason for that.</p>

<p>But I think that here problem is more about something I change in build process that changed the pjsip behavior.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I don't really understand why it gets broken but I changed the way build flags are set to ensure that armv6 build will not be built with pjsip flag about floating point set to 1. 
The strange point is that I did never change that since a lot of time. The only thing I changed recently was about echo cancellation to enable the more complex algorithm of speex echo canceller.
But, the good point is that if it actually previously did builds with floating point set to 1 in pjsip while build process had no support of floating point it could explain lags in the rest of the app. Cause this flag is not only there for echo cancellation. So maybe the activation of the speex algorithm had underline the issue that was present since a long time ago on armv6 devices and that now apps will be much faster on armv6 device independently of the echo cancellation :).</p>

The weird thing is in pjsip. It does not take into account the echo mode when starting the stack. As consequence it always use the default (for pjsip), which is in latest dev version speex cause I've enabled it in pjsip. 
The default for CSipSimple is Simple echo mode but since was not taken into account by pjsip .... it used speex AEC... </p>

<p>So now r597 (which will be on nightly builds server soon, I've launched a manual build), will force the choice of the echo canceller option when call is established (this method seems to be valid :) ).</p>

<p>I thought previously that it was fixed cause I used the option in media while in call to test to deactivate/reactivate echo cancellation which use the good method. And once it's done one time it's keep in mind by pjsip... reason why I thought it was fixed ... even if what I changed was absolutely not related.... :/</p>

<p>So for armv6 devices, should now be fine with simple echo canceller (but you should never activate speex echo canceller cause it will be efficient only with armv7 devices).</p>

<p>Could you confirm? Thanks in advance for tests.</p></markdown-widget>

The simple echo canceller doesn't seem to have a significant impact on CPU.  However it doesn't seem to add much to call quality either.  At least in my simple tests, the echo seems about the same with or without the canceller enabled, and with it enabled the sound quality seems slightly worse, so I think I'll leave it disabled unless I can find some settings that make it work better (tails of 200, 500, and 1000ms all sounded the same to me).</p></markdown-widget>
