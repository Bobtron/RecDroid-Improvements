                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Watch for CSS sending REGISTER requests
2. See that CSS sends x3 REGISTER requests instead of just one</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expected the common sequence of messages between CSS and SIP server:
1. CSS sends REGISTER
2. SIP server replies: Status 401 Unauthorized
3. CSS sends REGISTER
4. SIP server replies: Status 200 OK 
Instead:
1. CSS sends REGISTER
2. SIP server replies: Status 401 Unauthorized
3. CSS sends REGISTER
4. CSS sends REGISTER  &lt;- unnecessary
5. CSS sends REGISTER  &lt;- unnecessary
6. SIP server replies: Status 200 OK </p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Android 4.1.2. CSS r2025</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
Please take a look at picture of log, collected with Wireshark:
<a href="http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/8741/cssregisterx3.png">http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/8741/cssregisterx3.png</a></p>

<p>Common scenario packets are: 104, 105, 106 and 109.
Extra REGISTER packets are: 107, 108, 123, 125, 137, 138, 144, 145.</p>

<p>Usually CSS sends x3 second REGISTER packets. But sometimes it can make x3 first packets too. At the bottom of the log CSS you can see case, when CSS sends x3 first REGISTER packets (136, 137, 138). Server replies with just two packets: 140, 142. It doesn't send 3rd reply, because it gets packet 141 with all info needed...</p>

<p>One more problem - unnecessary KA messages, CSS sometimes sent when it sends its REGISTER requests. Look at packets 109, 124, 139. There is no need to send KA packets at those times. </p></markdown-widget>

So the first packet is retransmitted if no replay after 500ms. From timestamp I see in your screenshot it seems correct.</p>

<p>If you'd like to change this (these) values accordingly to your network latency/ or server delay to reply, you can configure it in csipsimple.
Go in settings (enable expert setting mode if were not already done).
Then in Network section you have some subsection about SIP protocol.</p>

<p>Here you'll see T1, T2 and T4 values that you can configure. By default it's -1 meaning "use default values advised in rfc".</p>

<p>Just to check I'm not saying something wrong (as that's what I understood from pjsip and didn't developped this part) you can extra check the RFC 3261.
I think that the relevant section is :</p>

<p>--- From RFC 3261 -- about invite but should also apply to register ---
For unreliable transports
   (such as UDP), the client transaction retransmits requests at an
   interval that starts at T1 seconds and doubles after every
   retransmission.  T1 is an estimate of the round-trip time (RTT), and</p>

<h2>   it defaults to 500 ms</h2>

<p>From your wireshark that's exactly what is observed, one transmition 500ms later and a second one 1 sec after the first retransmission.</p></markdown-widget>

It looks like they made some changes, leading to this effect, at the time I tried to move CSS into Android 4.1.2 environment. Thank you for pointing that out and sorry, that I did not recognized it earlier.</p>

<p>But what about the second (small actually) problem - CSS sends unnecessary KA packets. In the log provided you can see such packets: 109, 124 and 139. They are sent immediately after CSS sends REGISTER requests, which doesn't make any sense. It doesn't happen all the time though, but quite often from what I see.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Yep you're right about KA packets (sorry I forgot to reply to this part).</p>

<p>But I'm a little bit puzzled. And here's why :</p>

<p>In one way it makes sense to have such packets as soon as the udp socket is open. 
As the goal of theses packets is to keep a NAT hole open (using the socket opened between you and the server), it can make sense to send KA packet to keep it alive whatever is done on SIP protocol side.</p>

<p>What's very important is that they are not sent in the middle of the sip request but normally that's never the case (I remember of one pjsip fix about that so should be fine).</p>

<p>Indeed it might be useless if there is some sip activity. 
But as you've just seen, sip timeout values could be modified by settings. So if no keep alive are sent while the app is trying to resend the register it could loose its NAT hole and so break the public ip:port resolution -- and so break the accuracy of  registration contact provided.</p>

<p>What do you think? Apart from network usage another reason to find it annoying could be that it's annoying on server side. But I don't know if sip should be robust to that or not before register process is complete.</p></markdown-widget>
