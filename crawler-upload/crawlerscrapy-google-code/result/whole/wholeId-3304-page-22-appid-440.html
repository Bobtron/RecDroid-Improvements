                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the report.</p>

<p>That's because of the way csipsimple registers to the outgoing call stuff. It's very fancy way for phones because it allow a seemless integration to GSM calls (it allows to choose and rewrite on the fly).</p>

<p>However, on tablet, since the intent I register on is never fired, CSipSimple never raise. It only raise another intent that should not really be registered on in telephony case but that skype use. That's why skype raise on the tablet and not csipsimple.
On the other side, skype can't do the filtering rewriting stuff on mobile. They also force the prompt of a native android popup to ask user to choose between dialer and skype (this may always prompt regardless of any filtering rule).
With other words what skype does is registering as an app for making a tel:xxxx call. While csipsimple registers for processing the tel:xxxx when sent as an make call.</p>

<p>Normally a clean fix will be to register on the fly to the root telephony intent if there is no gsm available on the phone (and only in this case).
I can also easily do a build that behaves as skype. But that will give a very bad user experience on phones.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I didn't explored yet this field.</p>

<p>The normal way to register these kind of intent is to declare it in a manifest file of the project. Which make things pretty static.</p>

<p>However it's sometimes possible to dynamically register an intent. But I don't know if it's possible for this telephone intent. That's why I accepted the issue because I have to try to dive into this problem and find the best solution.</p>

<p>There is also maybe other technical ways that could lead to same result. So I should dive in android source code once again :). 
The process to make call in android is tricky because it involves several apps, and there is maybe a way to integrate that could lead to better user experience. So it's worth to have a close look on how it's done on 3.0 &amp; 4.0 android source code :)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Just some precision I need to be sure it will goes the same on android 4.0,</p>

<p>When you are in the contact view, it shows the sms icon instead of the phone icon isn't it?</p>

<p>If it shows the phone icon, you have probably a popup choice after that to allow you to choose between dialer and skype. </p>

<p>If not, maybe you have forced the choice to be by default skype (to check that go in android application management, go in skype and check if the 'reset default actions' button is enabled or not (if enabled you probably tell skype to be the default for something).</p>

<p>In fact, I'll have some fix for android 3.0 without gsm because I'm able to test it on a real device, but I really need your details for android 4.0 because I can read the source code of android 4.0 but I'm not sure of what are the values on your device. On my asus transformer in 3.0 it seems in line with android source code.</p>

<p>But the fact that skype is able to launch seems to me possible <em>only</em> if they register the SMS intent, which sounds a crappy way to do that... but well if no other choice...</p></markdown-widget>

<p>On opening a contact in the stock app, it shows 'connections' which shows skype and then chatting, calling, messages. Maybe this should show your app to. You know ,what i mean? Or would you like a screenshot?</p>

So they don't really handle the "tel:" intent... they just add some additional infos to the contact...</p>

<p>You can just do the same with csipsimple by adding a sip: uri to your contact (either adding an internet call entry, or an im entry with custom protocol "sip" or "csip").</p>

<p>Future version of csipsimple will allow to apply some batch on contacts (as apparently skype does without asking your for choosing that...) to create "csip" uris from phone numbers. But that's actually faking the integration ;).</p>

<p>However, next nightly build will include some change to make csipsimple register as a sms app if I detect that the android platform does not support phone calls.
Regarding android source code of the contact application, this is the only way to <em>cleanly</em> integrated telephone number intent.
I tested on my asus transformer 1 that is still under android 3.0. The nightly build will be produced in a couple of minutes, if you can test on 4.0 and tell me how it goes will be welcome ;)</p>

I hope that it will not introduce side effects since it registers on the "sms" intents. Do not hesitate to report if you find some weird side effect with that.</p>

<p>Only one small thing that I am curious about. After choosing CSS it also ask for CSS and Mobile. On my Transformer 1 there is no Mobile. Choosing Mobile it returns me to Contacts for adding the number as a new contact.</p>

<p>In CSS I can choose between VoIP and Mobile as a standard for outgoing but I can't find a setting that disables Mobile. Settings are: WIFI only, 3G, GPRS and Edge are all disabled. Using other networks is always up. Very strange.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, that's parts of the side effect :)</p>

<p>In fact mobile is just about the fact csipsimple detects a phone application that actually exists on the tablet apparently but has just the feature 'phone' disabled which made it behaves a different way.</p>

<p>In this case, there is a very simple workaround that you can apply. Since you don't want to use the "application" telephony, you can add a csipsimple filter to exclude gsm from outgoing means :)
The filtering/rewriting rule is very powerful for this kind of stuff.
Go in settings, filters, press the mobile row and add a filter 'don't call' with matching "all"</p>

<p>That's it :)</p>

<p>You can also create rules for skype if you download and install the csipsimple skype plugin available on the nightly website (it in plugin folder)</p></markdown-widget>

Install latest nightly build (if you reverted meanwhile to market version).
Go in settings, press menu key and select expert mode.
Then go in user interface section.
Here you have two options. One is Activate integration and the other is Integrate privileged intent. Deactivate the first one (simple integration), and activate the "integrate privileged intent". Go back to dialer to save.</p>

<p>Maybe you'll need to kill and restart the contact app (so that it detects there is a new app able to manage privileged intents). This new setting make CSipSimple integrates the same way skype, viber and some other voip client does. It should be activated for non phone devices, however since I've not yet a Nexus 7 on my hands I'm not able to do the auto-detection of it ;). As soon as I'll received it I'll add autodetection so that you'll not need the complex manual setting above ;).</p>
