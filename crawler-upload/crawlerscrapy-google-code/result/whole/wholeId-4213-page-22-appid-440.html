<p>I love your app, but finding contacts to dial is quite cumbersome. The stock android dialer has at least the search button functional as an aid.
How about this feature: instead of plain number field where the keyed numbers go, you implement an AutoCompleteTextView where I can start typing a contact and their numbers appear. I click on a number to select it, then change the SIP provider if I wish and place the call. Much faster to dial someone and a fairly simple in nature. </p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Yes would be a nice enhancement indeed.
That's not critical at all cause as I repeat since the begining of the project the way to use a SIP application is not to have contact inside the application.
The android approach is to make apps interact with each other. And the integration with the contact app of your phone (the stock app or any contact app) is already very good. The access inside csipsimple is "only" for those who don't want integration of CSipSimple with the rest of android but should be a minority of people !</p>

<p>I think that providing contacts from the app is a misuse of possibility of android. Android is an OS really really well designed for that kind of integration. 
For example what you use to dial and manage your contact is not the telephony application. It's the Contact application that interact with the Telephony application and when CSipSimple is installed with the SIP application !!!</p>

<p>There is no frontend for the telephony application. In an ideal world I'd not have to put any frontend for CSipSimple. 
I did cause the stock android contact app is not well designed to manage several backends for outgoing calls and cause some users have bad habits with other SIP apps that "force" them to dial inside the app...</p>

<p>However, as far as CSipSimple integrate contacts yes, we could imagine several things....
I'll rework a little bit how CSipSimple allow to dial from contacts and from text SIP uri. (I'll do one merged pickup - uri tool that may also allow to search through call logs).
Once done, if you want to contribute and add the autocomplete feature you'll be welcome :D... CSipSimple is a true opensource project and contributions are welcome :).</p>

<p>So I accept the issue in a low priority. I'll notify you on the issue once I've refactored pickup sip uri tool. And if you want to have a look and propose some better contact picker than the simple and reliable one obtained by the android pickup contact intent you'll be welcome.</p>

<p>You can also contribute to the core android project and modify the default pickup contact view so that it allow to autocomplete.... In theory it should be the right place to do that cause it will benefit <em>all</em> android apps that pickup a contact using the standard, optimized and reliable intent.</p>

<p>(And I think that such a modification would be accepted by the android opensource project... that's not so hard to contribute to android ... I did one patch for music and was accepted without problems)</p></markdown-widget>

is futile. I am working on a free messaging app right now and want to
make the selection of a contact as easy as it is possible. All
contacts shall stay within the stock contacts app and they only shall
be accessed through a lookup to select the recipient. Here is my code,
it is functional, but not optimized yet.</p>

<p>What are the main points:
- click in the text field to type for a name;
- filter the contacts database for matches;
- click on a number to paste it into the auto complete box;
- on the preferences screen there is a filter that allows to show all
numbers, mobile numbers only, or SIP numbers in your case;</p>

<p>I came to this idea when I had to dial a few SIP address numbers,
every time I have to retype or go through the long contacts list which
is rather slow. Google is all about search, I wonder why their phone
app does not have functional search box right up top.</p>

<p>Just quick tip : on android you can actually search through contacts :
Use the search widget (not the websearch one, the android search one). 
You have to add contacts in search databases (when you click on the little "G" drop down you can select sources of search -- contacts should already be there) that you want to search through contacts too, but once you search on this widget on home screen it will autocomplete with your contacts... and many other things if it found, there is actually an api so that a third party app can register here and provide a way to search in it's own database !
Then you can simply choose to click on the user badge and make a call from there :).
This feature was added in android 1.6 and is the "core" of android (cause it's developed by google). 
It's the reason why this search bar is by default on home screens.... it allow to search in SMS, in contacts, in web, in music, in twitter, applications and with voice search, mails, apps.... 
It also prove how well is designed android and it's intent system that allow apps to inter-work with each other.</p>

<p>In 2.3 as SIP uris will be supported by contacts it will be even better (and text uris will be accepted too ;) )</p></markdown-widget>

Think about processes in the order of a human being. Let's take this
as an example: "I want to call Sarko."
First comes the action, you are looking for an app to place the call
through, then you are looking for the person, then you are looking for
the proper number label, then you are looking for the cheaper option,
network or SIP call. If you handle the interactions in the order a
person thinks, your app becomes 'intuitive' to use.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I recently added a hack where if you set a custom IM of type 'SIP', that address will appear in the phone number selector after selecting a contact from that little people icon. So if you put baychev@somesip.aa.bb, you'll be offered sip:baychev@somesip.aa.bb as one of the 'numbers'. I use real sip addresses for a few of my frequent contacts, very handy to bypass any SIP provider or "phone company" and address any extension at the other end if you know it. Oh, and with SRV support you really have it all. The native dialer is useless for these things.</p></markdown-widget>
