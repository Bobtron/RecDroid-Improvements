Sending an SMS through VoIP provider configured to send message to the registered device via SIP MESSAGE.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expect CSipSimple to receive and display the message.  However, CSipSimple does not appear to receive the message.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
.003-01 r1108 on 2.3.5 (installed to a Galaxy S2).</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
Messages can be sent via CSipSimple with no trouble.  However, I was able to receive messages through MizuDroid, so it seems like it might be a CSipSimple issue, maybe just in the settings.  VoIP provider in this case is Anveo.com.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>On you side, can you try to collect some logs when some message should be received: 
see HowToCollectLogs wiki page. Maybe there's a clue on what's going wrong if that's on csipsimple code. </p>

<p>Could also be something with the way to register. By default csipsimple register using the registrar as proxy (in most case it helps a lot the sip provider). Maybe in your case it should not be done. Could also be the username (not authorization name, but username) that is expected to be different.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok thx for logs.</p>

<p>Sounds the app does not receive the event from server. So the problem probably is before.
The weird thing is that the presence publish is refused by the server. As if the presence server does not recognize you as user.
I guess you are using expert wizard. So maybe some things you can try to test.</p>

<p>The first thing I think about is that the user domain name space can be different from the sip registrar domain name. For now you have the registrar (and proxy) set to "sip.anveo.com" and SIP ID set to "xxxxxx@sip.anveo.com". Regarding OPTION pings from the server it sounds their domain namespace for users is simply "anveo.com"
So what you could try is to change <em>only</em> the SIP ID field to "xxxx@anveo.com" (instead of @sip.anveo.com).</p>

<p>If you are not already in expert wizard, long press on the wizard row and choose wizard &gt; expert.</p>

<p>It could help if their sip server does not consider you are registered as the correct receiver for this account if you register with @sip.anveo.com instead of @anveo.com.
This could explain why on the other sip client you only receive. If anveo allow to receive on @anveo.com and only send using @sip.anveo.com it may explain why csipsimple only send for now and the other only receive. If so, normally with the modification in the wizard csipsimple should be able to both send and receive.</p>

<p>If this helps, I'll create a wizard for this sip provider (I may also ask you more details about what are settings that I should hardcode).</p>

<p>Also, I tried to search on this provider website about how they manage SIP message. I found this page : <a href="http://www.anveo.com/api.asp?code=apihelp_sms_receive_sip">http://www.anveo.com/api.asp?code=apihelp_sms_receive_sip</a> . I'm not sure to understand the last line. Does they sell hard sip phones and mean by this that you can't have two sip phones connected to receive sip message? Or is that something different?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>However, weird that anveo.com does not refuse the connection :/. It sounds not very secured way to register an user if they don't check and refuse when contact and authorization name does not match the same "user" in their database. </p>

<p>Well, maybe they actually refuse if that's an contact id that match another user, but if not, it would mean that you can take the id of another user to get his sms (at least) and maybe his calls too :S... If so you should raise the problem to anveo cause it's probably critical security problem on their side.</p>

<p>About the wizard, would be great ideed : if you have to use expert wizard mode, it means that a dedicated wizard is required :).
I need : 
* a 48x48px png icon (I could find that on the web if you don't have a fancy one).
* infos I should hard code : sip proxy, sip registrar, user domain name, actually every characters and click you did in expert wizard that is not linked to your private account. ;) The goal is to reduce as much as possible user interaction to configure account.
* Additional info on remaining field. For example if username/authorization name is always the same with this provider. Or if username/authorization is always a phone number for this provider (in this case, instead of raising standard keyboard, I raise the digit keyboard so that it's faster to enter username ;) ).
* Additional settings you changed in global settings (if any). 
* And the list of countries where anveo.com is available.</p></markdown-widget>
