                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the very interesting point.</p>

<p>Strange that it changes when charging or not and that other VoIP apps works fine.
There is not so many things in android API to change lock the CPU and csipsimple use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</a>
that is normally the one to lock CPU.</p>

<p>However in your case seems more linked to wifi no? If works (almost) correctly on 3G (btw, in 3G it's not recommanded to use pcmu that is 64kBit/s codec which is very high).</p>

<p>So maybe something with CPU/wifi topic. On that there is a little bit more options available to developers.
The weird thing is that it comes more complex from android 2.3 and you are using 2.2 from your description so should not be impacted.</p>

<p>If you have time to run two test I would be very interested in the results you get :</p>

<p>#1 : go in android settings, in wifi section, in advanced parameters menu. There is an option to "Keep wifi active in sleep mode when"... here normally 3 choices : never, always or when charging. I suspect you are in the charging mode. Can you confirm? Also, can you change that temporarily to "Always" just for the test. Then test a call and see if better. </p>

<p>#2 : while in call, try to switch from speaker on/off to see if it changes something. </p>

<p>I would also be interested in packet loss you get in RX stream while in communication to determine if something with network or with media.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, so probably linked to issue 601. I merge with it.</p>

<p>I guess there is one profile in setCPU to change policy when phone is charging (there's one by default).
What's still strange is that other apps can get rid of that.</p>

<p>In fact SetCPU uses root priviledges to be able to change CPU policy. So it would be a security problem if another third party app such as csipsimple without root priviledges would be able to change cpu governor policy.</p>

<p>As you seems skilled in tech, maybe would be interesting to run in adb when in call with csipsimple and when in call with other app that works :
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
To see if there is difference.</p>

<p>I don't think other apps will change the cpu governor mode directly but maybe they match a rule in setCPU that changes the governor... the question is which one ;). (Or maybe it's csipsimple that make the state matching another rule that change to worse cpu governor mode of setCPU).</p></markdown-widget>
