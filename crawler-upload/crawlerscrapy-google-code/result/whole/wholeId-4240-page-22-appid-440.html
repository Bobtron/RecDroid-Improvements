                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Current implementation should be already almost functional with current codec2 code. However, AFAIK, for now no sip server support this version of the code of codec2. (Freeswitch does but that is on an older version of the codec so that it will not work with csipsimple unless you update the source of codec2 in freeswitch branch).</p>

<p>So for now, not yet stable enough to be shipped with csipsimple. Will be when codec2 will be released for VoIP apps.</p>

<p>As for amr-nb... well, the biggest problem here again (like for g729) is license of the codec. That is really really really annoying for me. I know that technically it's absolutely possible and I already almost know how to do it. However, problem is license. And that sucks. 
An alternative could be to re-use the existing implementation available on android system which could get rid of license. (Cause if available on the android platform ,which should be the case, it mean that the manufacturer has paid the license fee for you). But using this method mean using the java interface for encoding/decoding. And I fear that it will result very poor results.
If the choice is native implementation it mean reusing amr port available in android source code. It's opensource... however distributing it probably require to pay for fees. And as an alone developer (doing csipsimple just for my pleasure) I can't manage paying for the codec and I don't want to bother with distributing a paid version. </p>

<p>So for now amr is really low in my priority list for codecs. If I do I have to dive into the codec license and that's really borrrrriiinnnggg ... I'm a coder not a lawyer and spending time to study what I can do to be compliant with law is far to be what I prefer.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Agreed. amr codec requires a license and unless you can re-use the existing Android amr libs, you probably would run into licensing issues. But how do you handle g.729? It is the same thing and you have it enabled in csipsimple. Checking with the Asterisk or FreeSWITCH folks, they are very serious when it comes to g.729 or amr licensing..</p>

<p>So, codec2 would be nice. Yes, FreeSWITCH's version of codec2 would need to get bumped. We can work on that. But I was reluctant to spend time as I have no counterpart for testing. And I agree with you again, until codec2 is ready for prime use, you probably don't want to make it available by default in your software. If you could add a compile switch, so that someone could activate that code and use it for testing, would be great. As I said before, I am happy to help testing. I'd also work to get the FS codec2 code updated. Would be nice if we could work on that together.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I need some indications regarding the use of G729 codec on sipsimple.</p>

<p>I configured csipsimple to use my sipsorcery account and I would activate G729 codec support but I don't know if all sip providers configured on my sipsorcery account already pay licenses fees for that codec.</p>

<p>If I want to buy one license to use it with csipsimple as stated above is the following link right to buy a proper type of license? (or is it only for Asterisk?)
<a href="http://store.digium.com/productview.php?product_code=G729CODEC">http://store.digium.com/productview.php?product_code=G729CODEC</a></p>

<p>If it's right is required any further action to properly register the license bought with my csipsimple after the purchase or I'm just finished after activating it in the codec menu?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your support</p>

You should ask them directly if buying a license for their server also grant you right to use it in a sip softphone.</p>

<p>g729 is included in csipsimple only cause of the pressure of guys with providers that already pay for them and that only provide support of g729 codec (and no other codecs).</p>

<p>The media recorder is not really placed on the good level. It's not suitable for streaming, but there is other files in android source that are interesting.
