This scheme allows transparent calling with no account selector UI appearing at all:
1) one ambiguous filter "Dial directly"/ALL for the dialer handling most of the calls. 
2) several "Dial directly"/RegExp? exception filters for multiple SIP accounts for specific calls. </p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
What currently happens: the dialer generic filter overrides all the SIP specific filters. 
I have to create a bogus Dialer/SIP "Can't call" filter for EACH specific SIP "Dial directly rule" making the whole filters logic ineffective and duplicated.</p>

<p>What I expect: more specific filters should take priority over more generic filters OR I must have an option to reorder the way filters are processed by accounts (e.g. making Dialer filters affect the last). </p>

<p>BTW, making something more complicated would be overengenieering and will lost mainstream users. I usually try to focus on mainstream users and try to add hidden features for expert users. But when there is a conflict between what is better for mainstream users and what would be cool for 0.1% of users, I priviledge mainstream users ;).</p>

<p>About 3-rd party dialers, yes, indeed, that now managed through plugins. <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/plugins/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/plugins/</a>
(Preivously you was probably unable to use SIPNET entry cause nothing where done in csipsimple to manage that). Now SIPNET app (or a third party app) can do the integration which is much more clean.</p>

<p>About echo mode, yes indeed, now default is WebRTC echo canceller. It is much more better than speex and simple and can run low cpu devices. (WebRTC is a project from google). So yes, indeed it change the default value, but it should be by far better. Let me know if not. I'm pretty interested in feedback about that.</p></markdown-widget>

<hr>

<p>I can't call this little logic enhancement over-engineering:
1) the implementation is simple
2) the logic is simple (adding priorities over accounts isn't something far from average user understanding)
3) it streamlines implementing trivial use cases (on the contrary, I can call over-engineering making excessive "can't call" filters for a use case as simple as mine) </p>

<p>Try to go in settings &gt; filters. You'll see the "Use GSM" option at the bottom. In your case just add a "Force call" rule on it. </p>

<p>About implementation, it is not as easy as you think. If you propose a patch for that it will be welcome ;).
About the logic, it would mean having an order of accounts in filters and another one in account list... not sure that will be easy to understand for a mainstream user. 
You are a power user, so you even understand how things works behind, but you'd be amazed of how a mainstream user use an application.</p>

<p>Anyway, you are absolutely true, this feature is not documented enough. There is a wiki page about that but that's not enough yet. Unfortunately I have very very few time for developping, and less for documentation ;). This is an opensource project I do only on my free time (nights and holidays), so if you want to contribute to the wiki it will be welcome :D</p></markdown-widget>

<p>There is also an option to boost (by software) the micro level. It can also help. 
The weird thing is that I have not this behavior on my SGS1 (well with a cyanogenMod -- which is by far better than samsung roms ;) ). Echo canceller can indeed reduce a lot micro source, but only in cases the echo is high. 
Samsung device produce a lot of echo by form factor (and materials). So if listening sound level is high it can produce a lot of echo that the app try to cancel. In this case, software amplification is a good idea.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I've updated to the latest trunk (r1015). 
For me it behaves rather unstable: 
random app shutdowns (without crashing); strange "Internet calls not supported" messageboxes when pressing "Dial" button from the call log; constant messing with SIP registration processes (is this necessary at all?); I have a weird feeling that some filters had moved from one account to another and I can't find any difference regarding filters behaviour. 
Can I downgrade to the market version without losing settings (I wonder if Backup feature keeps only account settings)?</p>

<hr>

<p>I was accessing filters from the Settings screen. I see there is "Use mobile" group but I don't see any "Force call" option, only "Directly call" and there are no priority/reorder options.</p>

<hr>

<p>As for the implementation I'd suggest you:
a) simplify things (e.g. merge Accounts and Filters settings into one entity; I didn't even know that account settings had links to filter settings before you pointed this out. Sometimes having <em>less</em> ways to do the same task is beneficial)
b) legitimate and improve things you <em>already</em> had implemented (you already -implicitly- have two-level filter structure hence my suggestion of adding Mobile filters to the up-level group doesn't pretend to be a major design change).
I can't see how simple and well-structured concepts would harm a regular user.</p>

<p>Can't help you with patches as I'm not into system programming but I'm open to sharing ideas. </p>

<p>I have SGS2, not 1.
Can't see this IN_COMMUNICATION micro source. Tried all other sources but only MIC works properly. 
Mic boost has no effect on echo cut off. </p></markdown-widget>
