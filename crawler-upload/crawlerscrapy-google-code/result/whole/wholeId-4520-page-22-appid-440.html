<p>Most of the time inactive is shown cause it doesn't try to register. For example you are on 3G and in settings "I'm allowed to use over 3G is not checked". Else we get some red message saying there were a problem while registering.
Could you send me logs (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/HowToCollectLogs">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/HowToCollectLogs</a>) . There is maybe a regression due to the fact dns request are now done directly using nameservers of android and not fallbacking to the standard dns resolution.</p>

<p>If you can provide me your logs with 13-05 when you try to deactivate/reactivate an account (click on the status button on the left of the account name in accounts list just before sending logs). It will help me a lot. Thx in advance</p></markdown-widget>

I went back to -13-04 with the same results.
Then I went back to -13 and after rebooting it worked as before. I'll stay with that version until new one comes out.

That's strange many people has this issue with latest versions some from -05 and not -04. I guess was due to the recent introduction of DNS SRV resolution &amp; SRTP &amp; TLS.
These options are used in the startup process of pjsip and if it fails somewhere, it can show this kind of behavior.</p>

<p>Just some precautions : uninstall before installing a new dev version (at least if you use an older version or if you switch between market/dev version).
Ensure there is not other SIP app running... sometimes other apps use the same ports than CSipSimple... for example if SipDroid is running (even in background and silently listen to a port), CSipSimple will not run at all or sound will be broken.</p>

<p>If you reproduce with 13-06, I'm interested by logs :) !</p>

<p>So just to be sure that I well understand :
If Resolve DNS SRV is disabled, you can register with stun activated?</p>

<p>Could you just make a try with :
* DNS SRV : activated
* STUN : activated and set to stun.3cx.com
* ICE : DISABLED (I think that's the key point).</p>

<p>I'm wondering if ICE doesn't require TURN to be enabled too.. Or there is something with ICE I have to check. But, just try to disable ICE, and see if things are going better.</p></markdown-widget>

Also the state change from 'calling...' to 'ringing...' seems slower.
In my case, it is appropriate to disable DNS SRV, mybe it could be the default state.
In my configuration STUN and ICE are disable.
In version 0.00-13-04 registration was istant. 
This speed is very convenient for users using csipsimple only for outgoing calls.</p></markdown-widget>

It works ok, meaning it registers nice and quick.
When I use srtp (mandatory) it registers fine but don't seem to get through when I call my number to test it. Works better without it (disabled)
Same with DNS SRV, don't register (stays inactive) works great without it.
Same with IPv6 stays inactive when I use it, works great without it.
ICE and STUN are turned on.
Not sure if all those settings have to do with the voip service I use really. Not very advanced user. Just hope this info will help.</p>

I think that DNS SRV will be by default disabled in the future. I guess it concern not so much users. And those who are concerned has an advanced skill on sip so, will not be chocking for them to go in DNS SRV and activate it.
@ometaxas : ok that confirms that DNS SRV + ICE + STUN has a bug. I'm still waiting for feedback from pjsip guys (but the mailing list is not really active the week end)
For SRTP mandatory : your server/remote contact <em>must</em> support SRTP else communication will not be established. There is not so much sip client / server that authorize SRTP however. More support ZRTP... but I'm still investigating to know how to support it.
For IPv6 : your network and your phone <em>must</em> be configured in full IPv6 else nothing will happens (initialization of the stack will simply failed silently as if network were not present or busy).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I have tried with DNS SRV + ICE + STUN on my wifi (and not using ekiga.net) and it did work good!</p>

<p>Tried the same with the network internet and it was taking a while to register. I have noticed in the past sometimes if you change many settings and try to register it takes long time, like it is too quick to apply the new settings or something. Anyway I decided not to wait and I rebooted the phone and worked good.</p>
