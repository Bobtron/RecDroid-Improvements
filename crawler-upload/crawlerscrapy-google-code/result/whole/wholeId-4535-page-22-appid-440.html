                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>I'm really comfortable right now with status of csipsimple, so this is just a feature-request which would really help me a lot.</p>

<p>Since I've some SIP-Accounts only available in local WLAN (internal IP), and some available nearly always (external SIP-provider) but not in special WLAN (university-WLAN with NAT-disaster), the following would be really nice:</p>

<p>Allow to specify when to use each account, not only general:
* Use on 3G
* Use on 4G
* Use on bluetooth
* ... whatever other connection available
* Use on WLAN (general)
** First entry: always (default)
** Next: List with all know APs, multiple can be selected</p>

<p>The "Use on WLAN" should function like this:
- If only "use on WLAN" is selected and the user did not make any decision on which APs, every AP (and new ones) will be activated (which is also the default and like it is now, so "always" is preselected).
- If the user selects some APs (or even all currently available), new APs will be automatically deactivated and must be explicity enabled by the user</p>

<p>An account deactivated because of this could have a new status/color in the notice ("currently inactive"/blue?).</p>

<p>Also it should not be in the list of accounts to select when making a call, just like inactive ones. Besides this, i think this will help also in battery-usage, since the accounts will not tried to be reregistered all the time (or do not have to be deactivated by hand always).</p>

<p>If this idea suites you and you need any helping hand with this, i could spend some time implementing this. Just pass me the details how to do this (fork the trunk, send patches, or branch it in a way? Did not work with google code before).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well, I think that for the main app, this is over-engineering.
<em>However</em> this feature request make absolutely sense and I understand the need.
To do that kind of feature I think that the best approach is to write a third party app or a plugin for an existing app (for example tasker - there is another issue (issue 267) about that).</p>

<p>CSipSimple is designed to allow other android apps to control almost everything ! And the kind of feature you want could be performed using the API provided by csipsimple (or if not we could enrich the API).</p>

<p>In fact my approach is to do a core sip application that is reliable and on which other apps could rely to answer to specific users needs.</p>

<p>For example it will allow sip providers to write their own app and rely on csipsimple to do all sip stuff... The provider app will just have to provide an account setting and let csipsimple do everything else.
Another example could be an app that manage your contacts and bring an alternative dialer, with a deeper integration with contact and their sip accounts
Another example could be what you propose.
Another example could be an alternate in call controller (I've already done some Proof of Concept based on the existing csipsimple that override the in call control UI).</p>

<p>I consider that these features are not core features. This features could be very valuable, but for mainstream users, I guess that they will consider that as too much complicated to use.</p>

<p>So I deeply advise you to take this approach. BTW, it's the global approach of the android system : the contact&amp; dialer app is different from the telephony one. Applications play with each others !
If you want to do such an app it could be hosted on csipsimple project however and also licensed under gplv3 (I deeply encourage it). Btw, if you need some other APIs than the existing one you'll be able to enrich it too ;).
Let me know if you want to participate this way.</p></markdown-widget>
