Clear audio, callee received massive echoes after everything they said</p>

Using the latest in the download section 12.06</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
Massive echo on the call received end after everything they say.  Seems to be a polar issue as the callee either has a massive echo or does not.  All my settings are the stock settings.</p></markdown-widget>

The callee was getting an echo, and I just turned down my in-call volume... the echo went away! Apparently the feedback from the earpiece, which I had set loud, into the mic was causing the echo. The (normal) delay in a VoIP circuit, combined with the earpiece to mic feedback, produced the echo at their end. My solution: reduce the Microphone gain to 0.6, then restore my in-call volume to the usual setting (good for both Mobile and SIP calls). My callee said my voice was still plenty loud.</p>

<p>I am using a nexus one.  I notice that if I physically cover the mics on the phone, or if I set the earpiece volume to zero, there is still an echo for the other party.  That tells me that this isn't purely acoustic echo.  Of course, if I reduce the mic gain to zero, the echo goes away.</p>

<p>Here are some ways we can start:</p>

<p>Can you show me how to view the source (or pseudocode or similar) for pjmedia_echo_create() and pjmedia_echo_cancel()? </p>

<p>I am pretty sure you don't want the echo state to be PJMEDIA_ECHO_SIMPLE.  From the documents, that essentially turns off the acoustic echo canceller, creating simplistic echo suppression (probably a squelch or similar).  We should try PJMEDIA_ECHO_DEFAULT</p>

<p>Note that echo cancellation can be computationally expensive.  As we test, can you keep an eye on the resources consumed?  There are tricks to cut this down, once we get something working...</p></markdown-widget>

<p>One really important thing to know is that by default I try to choose options that will ensure the best compromise for <em>all</em> devices. It mean even those with low CPU.
Choosing SIMPLE seems to be the best compromise I get when I tested that over my 8 android phones ;). But maybe I should retest now since I've tweaked other parameters in the native stack.
At least now in latest dev builds, there is a way to set the echo mode. (see ExpertSettingMode to turn on expert settings).</p>

 * on my copy of the pjsip trunk; probably here <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fpjsip_android%2Fapps%2Fpjsip%2Fproject%2Fpjmedia%2Fsrc%2Fpjmedia">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fpjsip_android%2Fapps%2Fpjsip%2Fproject%2Fpjmedia%2Fsrc%2Fpjmedia</a>
 * or directly on pjsip website : <a href="http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/browser/pjproject/trunk">http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/browser/pjproject/trunk</a></p>

<p>I'm not sure that I'll be able to help you a lot about the implementation in itself cause this is done by pjsip guys (if you have remarks maybe worth to tell them directly and share on the pjsip mailing list).
Also what could be interesting, if you have some proposal of an implementation of the echo canceller (really different from an existing one) is to have your own echo canceller module : pjsip is well design as far as I can tell and will probably allow to implement easily a new backend for echo cancellation.</p>

<p>I can't say for the entire pjsip project, but at least if you do such a contrib, I'll use it in CSipSimple ;)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Could you also expose the latency_ms variable in the echo canceller?  This will allow you to put the canceller taps a little further out in time without having to increase the tail length.  Extending tail length slows the convergence of the EC.</p>

<p>Also, could you confirm that it is not necessary to exit and restart the program for these settings to be made?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Yes, the jitter buffer options would be nice, but I was going to start with     snd_rec_latency and snd_play_latency.</p>

<p>Basically, the shorter the latency, the longer the tail length needs to be, but long tail length means slow convergence</p>

<p>There may be some other ways to go at this as well.  A good way to train an EC is to feed it some wide-band noise.  Perhaps we could try that.</p>

<p>Also, it seems odd that the echo is not really affected when I cover the mic with my finger.  Acoustic echo should basically go away if you perform this "analog mute".  It makes me think that the software intentionally is feeding back some of the received signal.  This was done in the past to give the far-end talker a nice "reverb" sound to his voice, but is a disaster if there is delay in the line.

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>About first point : ec_options is what is in the interface of CSipSimple echo mode. I think that it impact more or less directly echo_create yes :
My code : (line 254 )
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/trunk/CSipSimple/src/com/csipsimple/service/PjSipService.java?r=485#254">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/trunk/CSipSimple/src/com/csipsimple/service/PjSipService.java?r=485#254</a>
And according the doc of pjsip for this option :
"""
Echo canceller options (see #pjmedia_echo_create())
"""</p>

<p>So I guess it's finally the same parameter :)</p>

<p>Ok, for latency I'll add that but I've first to check that it's really useful cause maybe directly given to the audio "driver" which is mine implementation and take only care of what is provided by the android API to get best results.</p>

<p>As for your last point.... well in fact that's what I think to be the cause of the problem. Cause pjsip is known to be reliable and I don't think that I use it an odd way and actually I've no echo at all on most of the devices I test.</p>

<p>Actually, on some device, some crappy manufacturer implement the android audio stack just like they want... Btw, when you try to use it a standard way you can get really unpredictable (from a device to another) results.
For example on samsung device their big problem is to implement correctly audio routing... reason why you'll find over the web a lot of problems with these devices + voice over IP applications.
Other, was the case for the XPeria X10 (a lot before the 2.2 upgrade but still observable now), has something really really annoying : when a third party app tries to record micro input.... it also get packets from audio output !!!! 
And so we get echo... that's a logical consequence... In this case nothing can be really done (except tuning audio amplification for micro and speaker).</p>

<p>There is some recent (but not compatible with all android versions) API that allow a more fine choice of micro channel and speaker channel. But (as not compatible with all android versions), I've not yet really tested this new API.</p>

<p>Maybe something that I should have asked before but :
@ken &amp; @tjborn : what device are you using?</p>

<p>If you get a really big echo, that's not something "normal" on phones I can test on, (nexus one, galaxy s, x10 mini, archos 5it, galaxy i5500, desire HD), I don't observe echo (or really quiet unless of course I use the two phones on the same room and I put them on speaker :) ). </p></markdown-widget>

is the wrapper
 * And the implementation of speex echo canceller comes from the speex third party :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fpjsip_android%2Fapps%2Fpjsip%2Fproject%2Fthird_party%2Fspeex%2Flibspeex">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fpjsip_android%2Fapps%2Fpjsip%2Fproject%2Fthird_party%2Fspeex%2Flibspeex</a></p>

<p>Just a guess. I'm not sure at all.
As usually pjsip is designed to allow several backends for doing a piece of work. Here several echo cancellation backend can be plugged to pjsip and used by it.</p>

<p>I've recently added SILK codec (it also had builtin echo cancellation, maybe could be interesting to see if this echo cancellation backend could not be plugged to pjsip). What do you think? Have you an idea on the quality of silk vs speex vs the simple pjsip backend?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Seems to be the used method by the pjsip wrapper. And after a simple grep :

<p>More amazing, there is already a way to use it in current csipsimple (if you have a CM7 on your SGS...) simply go in audio workaround settings of csipsimple and activate "MANUFACTURER_EXTRA" mode :). It was added here cause one manufacturer contacted me directly to have SIP support on their device and we choose exactly the same value than the one choosen by google :) lol...</p></markdown-widget>

At least it helped on official X10 rom where changing from Default micro source to Voice call micro source solved the problem. 
However it will not work on all roms and all manufacturer : this kind of problem is really linked to the way the manufacturer interpret the android audio api.
In android 2.3 it will be much much more clear since google has fixed things and added a micro source and an audio mode specifically for voice over IP. But previously it depends deeply on the way the manufacturer decided to implement things. Basically the reference I always took was the HTC implementation (cause they worked with google on first phones). 
Now all manufacturer seems to adopt this implementation (even samsung after google worked with them on the nexus S). But there is probably other manufacturers that are not yet aware about how to implement things cleanly on old ROMs.</p>

<p>If you find interesting things by trying to play with the audio routing troubleshooting options do not hesitate to share, I can automatically activate some option on some devices if it helps. (I already do for devices I had feedback for) </p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well, I think this is a breakthrough! (At least for me :-)</p>

<p>No echo!</p>

<p>Following Tim's experience, on my Nexus One, running CM6.1.1 (plus wildmonks's kernel without the audio boost), using the R822 nightly, I was able to use the Audio Routing hacks (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ?tm=6#Audio_routing_troubleshooting">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ?tm=6#Audio_routing_troubleshooting</a>) to reduce/eliminate my echo.</p>

<p>T be more precise, checking the "Use Mode audio API" seemed to work the magic.  Individually checking the routing API and Tone Hack had either no effect or minimal effect (I haven't done comprehensive testing yet).  However, the Use Mode Audio API hack (having it checked) worked!</p>

<p>In fact, it worked so well, I actually turned off the echo canceller (unchecked the "Echo Cancellation" option at the top), and still no echo (so far)!</p>

<p>Frankly, this makes a lot of sense.  As I mentioned above and in a posting on another site (<a href="http://bit.ly/i5jMQd">http://bit.ly/i5jMQd</a>), I've been chasing this Android/VoIP/Echo thing for a few months.  The echo I was hearing (often almost 1 second later) was not likely acoustic echo.  It seemed that there was a software bug that caused the echo.  Your hacks, and the fact that they reduce echo for me add further support to this theory.  It also makes sense that there is a bit of "variety" in how some of these audio APIs are executed, and this is a core issue.  Glad to hear that the later versions of Android will help here!</p>

<p>So, can you tell me what the "Use Mode Audio API" hack actually does?</p>

<p>I will also say that, like Tim, enabling this hack seemed to reduce the volume of the csipsimple talker (i.e. the microphone volume on csipsimple needed to be increased).  I actually increased it all the way to 10x, and it seems to work well.  Clearly we are working with some hacks here, but at least this gives hope for the future!</p>

<p>Great job, and thanks for your efforts!</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Good news.</p>

<p>Ok so I'll try to be a little bit more exhaustive about these hacks and what it does.</p>

<ul>
<li>The 'Use routing API' : the routing API is the old (android 1.6 and lower) audio routing API. Using this API we have to explicitly say where output goes. This API is deprecated since android 2.0 but some manufacturer still use it and sometimes it do things better than the new API (with setSpeakerphoneOn). The doc of this API is here : <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#setRouting%28int,%20int,%20int%29">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html#setRouting%28int,%20int,%20int%29</a> (you'll notice that it's marked as deprecated).</li>
</ul>

<p>If we don't check this option csipsimple tries to route using the new API (setSpeakerphoneOn).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 'Use mode API' (the one that make things better for you) : Here comes true hacks... In fact android audio API has something called mode. My understand of these mode is that it is some kind of "preset" that the audio layer has. I initially thought that MODE_IN_CALL was the good mode... however after talking with guys that implements things for some manufacturer, I understood that it was not a good idea and that the good mode to be sure it will be compatible with all devices will be MODE_NORMAL. The reason : some manufacturer use MODE_IN_CALL to directly plug the micro to the GSM chipset. As consequence in this mode audio packets are not always distributed to the application layer. Besides in this mode nothing ensure that setSpeakerphoneOn will works properly.
But, sometimes the MODE_IN_CALL mode is the only way to get routing to go through the earpiece.
So the 'Use mode API' use MODE_IN_CALL when you route to earpiece and MODE_NORMAL when you route to rear speaker. It's possible that some ROM does use hardware echo cancellation when MODE_IN_CALL is set (or use better preset for audio driver). However since the goal of this mode is GSM call nothing ensure that micro will works properly (you can have nothing at all or really quiet sound). It explains what you observe on your ROM.</p></li>
<li><p>The 'Audio mode for SIP calls' option is linked to the previous. While the previous play with MODE_IN_CALL and MODE_NORMAL, this one allow you to replace directly MODE_NORMAL by another mode (and mode in call is never used unless you select it explicitly). In android 3.0 there is a new audio mode : MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION (it's also available on some android 2.3 device as private api).
This mode is the thing we expect from long time. In this mode, google said : this one is for SIP calls !! So manufacturer has no more excuses . In this mode they have to do things cleanly so that there is no echo with micro ! If they do not the stock SIP app will not work at all, and I hope they check that. So if you are running android 2.3 or upper csipsimple will automatically try to activate this mode. Results are impressive in this mode. On my acer iconia tab, even with speaker set to maximum there is no echo at all !</p></li>
<li><p>The Galaxy S hack : first samsung hack... before android 2.3 and their work with google on the nexus S, samsung did things a really weird way on their device. With galaxy S it was the worse they did. It was not possible to get routing going through earpiece unless you use something I found after days and days of tests. It's the galaxy S hack. The audio mode explanation already give you headaches? ... well that was just the beginning... the galaxy S hack works as follow : it first enable audio mode MODE_IN_CALL and directly after it activate the MODE_NORMAL. Why? Because MODE_IN_CALL activate presets that does the correct output routing to the earpiece (but route the micro to the GSM chipset and not the app) and then MODE_NORMAL does the routing of the micro without modifying the output routing !! That's obviously a "bug" in the samsung driver (or at least something not consistant at all), but that's a chance cause else we could have absolutely no way to get the correct routing. That's why I sometimes want to cry when samsungs users cry about the fact they have echo : they already have a LOT of change to have something that route properly. It's already very very tricky to work with what samsung did!</p></li>
<li><p>The audio tone hack : second samsung hack ... other devices from samsung has another weird behavior -almost each one re-interprete the audio api ;) -. 
Using the normal mode, one of their device has some timer that after some very short time of inactivity close the sound device. Which is really annoying when you start a call cause RTP stream can not be established immediately. As consequence this hack just produce a quick and not audible sound at start of the audio.</p></li>
<li><p>Micro source : it allow to choose the micro source for the audio. Previously I always used DEFAULT, but now with android 3.0 (and some 2.3 as private API) there is a new source "VOICE_COMMUNICATION" that is specifically done for SIP calls and just like the MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION should really help with hardware echo cancellation and proper routing. Some device require to change this value - for example the motorola atrix. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For reference the relevant code about all of that :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/trunk/CSipSimple/src/com/csipsimple/service/MediaManager.java#229">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/trunk/CSipSimple/src/com/csipsimple/service/MediaManager.java#229</a></p>

<p>And the default settings for each device I had feedback for: 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/trunk/CSipSimple/src/com/csipsimple/utils/Compatibility.java#87">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/trunk/CSipSimple/src/com/csipsimple/utils/Compatibility.java#87</a></p>

<p>Hoping that could help other opensource project to solve their problem with the audio layer ;). Or if any has more experience than me or things to add on this point, do not hesitate it will be welcome :)</p></markdown-widget>

I've found that echo is now gone (when I perform the Use mode API hack) when just using my handset.  But if I plug in a wired headset (with mic), the same old echo returns.  Makes sense, as insertion of a headphone is likely to change the audio routing.  Any way that you can force the "Use mode API" when using wired headsets (haven't tried bluetooth yet)?</p>

<p>By the way, my sip provider is showing some love to csipsimple:

But could be interesting to have audio troubleshooting params per output (normal, bluetooth , headset). 
This morning I've noticed that on android 2.3 the new mode MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION does not allow to use Bluetooth... So I've added a test to fallback to mode normal if bluetooth is detected. Could be interesting to allow to fallback to other modes cause I would not be surprised if some other devices requires MODE_IN_CALL to have bluetooth working.</p>

I'm sure that it will not work (on android 2.2.1) because this mode was not there is the android 2.2.1 source code. Audio mode may not raise an exception. It will just probably fallback to default. The micro mode will raise an exception but I managed that in CSipSimple : so that it will fallback to the default micro source.</p>

<p>The only risk is that the audio mode raise an exception which will make the call crash. So if you are making an outgoing call make sure you are able to terminate the call on the other side ;).
After that, just restart csipsimple, it will (it should ;) ) restore previous settings (wifi sleep policy mode, audio mode, ringer mode). If it does not restore properly restart the phone and ensure the wifi sleep policy mode has not been changed to something you don't want (many apps change that and it drains the battery much faster, csipsimple also do this change but just for the time of the call if over wifi).</p></markdown-widget>

(I've read the code of the stock SIP application and that's why CSipSimple default settings are these ones).</p>

<p>Both are new API introduced in 2.3 code for the SIP application. Obviously manufacturer/ROM makers has to support it. But the goal of this is explicitely to use hardware echo canceller and to have things preset just for voice over IP calls.</p>

<p>Normally this new API is there in the android code as private api from android 2.3. If the ROM include and support well the stock sip app, this new api should work.... But it entirely depend on how the manufacturer implement things in their driver.
This new api is "official" in android 11 (android 3.0) so all manufacturer must support it on 3.0 and upper.</p>

<p>This is just how it <em>should</em> work. However audio is really touchy and each ROM and manufacturer implement things differently without really following the reference as it should be. As consequence, CSipSimple hacks could be useful and will permit to always have a way to be compatible the best possible way. (so in 2.3.4 if the echo is suppressed in the built-in SIP app, just change csipsimple settings to have the official API... and it will works as well !)</p></markdown-widget>

I tried VOICE_RECOGNITION, and it had little or no impact.  My default settings are micro source: VOICE_COMMUNICATION and audio mode IN_COMMUNICATION.</p>

<p>Note that echo is cancelled well when I use Mode audio API, but only when I use the normal handset pressed to my ear.  If I turn on either the speaker phone, or if I plug in a wired headset, the echo returns.  That again points to the fact that audio routing is the culprit. </p>

We had the same issue in IMSDroid (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/imsdroid/">http://code.google.com/p/imsdroid/</a>) and we were using Speex echo canceler. We finally fixed the issue in our latest release (imsdroid-2.0.448-webrtc) by using Google's WebRTC AEC (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/webrtc/">http://code.google.com/p/webrtc/</a>).
The source code of our implementation is available here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/doubango/source/browse/branches/2.0/doubango/tinyDAV/src/audio/tdav_webrtc_denoise.c">http://code.google.com/p/doubango/source/browse/branches/2.0/doubango/tinyDAV/src/audio/tdav_webrtc_denoise.c</a></p>

<p>Please note that for now we only enable AEC on ARMv7 device to avoid CPU overhead.</p></markdown-widget>

To enable the echo canceler: Menu -&gt; Options -&gt; Média -&gt; Annulation de l'echo.
I'm using Samsung Galaxy S (Android 2.2) and calling iPhone client with built-in echo canceler but I have echo. I can't say if it's better or not because the last time I tested CSipSimple it was in 2010. What is sure is that it's possible to get it working on CSipSimple (not the case for all Android VoIP clients) because the audio delay is low.
Which values are you using for echo tail and skew?</p>

<p>About AECM, we haven't tried it yet because the initial implementation based on WebRTC was for Windows and MAC OS X.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>@mamadou : in CSipSimple, by default it use the speex echo canceller (for armv7), you have to change the echo canceller method in settings. 
To do so, you have to activate the expert setting mode (in settings, press menu and select expert mode, then in media settings choose the cancller mode to be WebRTC. You can also change the tail length).
About skew, I use 0 for now. Do you have a suggestion for a better value?</p>

<p>I've seen that in doubango code you said that 16 and 32kHz produce weird results. On my side it does not sound so bad. What do you observe with doubango? </p>

<p>Also, in this case, I was wondering in this case what would be the best way to do :
bufferFarend, process, bufferFarend, process

bufferFarend, bufferFarend, process, process</p></markdown-widget>

I have calls setup to only use wifi with a business class comcast connect, or a 35/35mb frontier fiber connection at home.  At either location the callees hear themselves and have a really bad echo after about .1 to .3 seconds after everything they say  The only thing I have found that stops the echo completely is if I mute the mic in the dialer.  If I turn down the speaker/earpiece volume to about 6-7 notches up that usually helps alot and the echo is not nearly as loud.  I just loaded the march 5th nightly, and tried a few test calls which also had the echo.  I have asked other Nexus 4 users some have the issue some do not. I have attempted countless configurations of echo canceling in the main section and the audio troubleshooting section.  I think I have almost tried all the settings, and nothing makes any difference whatsoever.  If I knew how to I would send you a log of what my settings are now and try to list some of the settings I have tried. If there are any suggested settings I should try I'm completely open to suggestions at this point.  I really like the software and would love to get it working.  </p></markdown-widget>
