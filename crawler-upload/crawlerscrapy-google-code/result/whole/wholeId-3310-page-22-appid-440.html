                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Have a working bluetooth headset set up and connected to a Samsung Galaxy Note.
2. Install CSS, any version, nightly or market.
3. Find a combination setting in Expert Settings Mode that allows you to at least dial out using the bluetooth headset (in the case of the Note, that would be audio mode = normal, mic source = mic or default, samsung galaxy hack enabled). Place a call, connect, then end the call.
4. Try to receive a normal mobile call or SIP call to the phone with bluetooth on prior to receiving the call. You can only answer the incoming call using the phone, headset buttons are ignored, then when the call goes to the bluetooth headset there is no audio to the earpiece, nor is there audio picked up by the bluetooth mic.
4. Only way to fix bluetooth is to reboot the phone.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>Bluetooth should function normally when placing or receiving calls. Instead, I witness the issue above.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>Latest nightly. Android 2.3.6. Samsung Galaxy Note XXLA4 stock rom and AbyssNote 3.3 Kernel, rooted.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>Regis, I know this is an old issue, but I just thought I'd chime in because I thought I had the Galaxy Note figured out, but apparently not. And since it's such a popular phone, I figured maybe out of the kindness of your heart you might be able to issue a fix for it, as you did for a few things with the Galaxy S II.</p>

<p>Observations: when bluetooth is NOT connected, the following settings work: Galaxy hack enabled, audio mode IN_CONNECTION and mic source VOICE_CONNECTION, API routing and mode audio options disabled. If bluetooth is on, the phone will completely bypass the headset with the previous settings. The only way to get the headset to work when connected is to changed audio mode to NORMAL and mic source to MIC or DEFAULT. But these settings do not work with the phone when bluetooth is disconnected. In summary, I cannot continue to use CSS if I wish to use a bluetooth headset with the phone, as the ability to answer both mobile and SIP incoming calls through the headset is corrupted as soon as I place or receive one call using CSS. I have tried to just use WebRTC in place of everything, which completely ignores bluetooth altogether, but I couldn't even get that to function normally under both bluetooth-connected and not-connected scenarios. So at this point I am afraid I am forced to uninstall until either Samsung publishes a fix for the Note that conforms their audio implementation to the android standard (not likely) or until you are able to patch a fix together for the Note. I know that device-specific bluetooth patches on not a priority item for you right now, but I would be forever indebted if you might be able to figure something out that would allow me to use CSS again.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Currently using Acrobits Softphone as a mediocre replacement for now. It's a little buggy on its bluetooth handling as well, but somehow is still pretty usable and doesn't "break" bluetooth altogether. Perhaps you could get your hands on a copy and check out how it handles things compared to the way CSip does...</p>
