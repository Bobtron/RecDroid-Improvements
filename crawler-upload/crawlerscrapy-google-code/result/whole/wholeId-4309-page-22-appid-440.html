In this case you can test to disable the "keep awake while in call" option in CSipSimple. On other devices that HTC - and device I list as problematic devices), the option is disabled. And I know that cyanogen's ROM has already a fix for this PSP bug, so it's maybe included in your Oxygen ROM.</p>

<p>For point 1 =&gt; ok, maybe they simply prevent incoming GSM calls like other SIP apps.</p>

<p>For point 3 =&gt; some info after reading the code of the new SIP stack : they always lock CPU which I do not by default. 
Besides they do everything on the java layer so it may cost much CPU time. But I don't think that could be the cause of a loss of battery life (the lock CPU option if you didn't use it in CSipSimple, could be a good candidate however).</p></markdown-widget>

Or that they will face same problems than the one we get ;). 
But this time for issues related to device, manufacturer will test the 2.3 implementation (I'm thinking about that cause audio stack give me headache ;) ).</p>

<p>However, there is interesting things done in their implementation. I've already re-used the way they manage wifi reconnection (there is some kind a bufferization of the connect event).
The way they keep alive is really near the one done by SipDroid (they also use an Alarm). I think that I'll do the same, but implies to change pjsip. I'll have a look this holidays to find the best way to do that.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for taking time to test that and for sharing your findings :)</p></markdown-widget>

In 2.3 code I've noticed this code :
WifiManager.WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF</p>

<p>For the wifi lock. It's not in the API (not documented at all)... but as in another thread some user with nexus S report me that Nexus S also have PSP mode, google has maybe workaround it with WifiManager.WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF ....</p>

<p>Maybe could be an excellent idea to ask custom ROM makers if they'll have that implemented to deactivate PSP mode.</p>

<p>In previous API logic, would have been to deactivate PSP mode on simple WIFI_MODE_FULL mode (reason why I said there where a bug for PSP mode). But maybe this new constant (undocumented but existing and used by the stock SIP app), can match the good one for disabling PSP mode !</p></markdown-widget>
