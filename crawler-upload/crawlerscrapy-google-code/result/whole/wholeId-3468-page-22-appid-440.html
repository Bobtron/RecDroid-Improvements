                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>We are a Multi-location store looking to replace our aging phone system. As part of this project we would like to give some of our managers/clerks a smartphone with a SIP based softphone client (To be used on our WIFI network). I have tried many of the different clients on the Android market and non-completely fit our needs. What we are looking for is a client that would support Hot Desking. I believe this would be fairly easy to implement and could be a feature that really sets cSipSimple apart.</p>

<p>Let me explain….</p>

<p>Since we have retail stores we have multiple shifts and may have only a third of our employees working at any given time. So rather than purchase a separate phone for each employee and have 2/3’s of them sitting unused at any given time we would like to purchase only enough to cover the number of employees working at any given time. This creates a bit of a dilemma as each employee is assigned a unique extension number and all the WIFI phones (except Cisco) and all the softphones (for mobile devices) we have experimented with support static extensions only.</p>

<p>So…What we would like is the ability for an employee to start his shift by grabbing a phone, entering his credentials and viola the phone he has becomes his extension for the day.</p>

<p>With all the softphones currently available you could do something similar by having a separate account for each employee and training them how to switch accounts, however that creates a management nightmare for the IT department as they would have to touch each phone every time a new employee starts or someone leaves.</p>

<p>The solution I believe would be for a softphone vendor to simply split the SIP settings into 2 parts, one for the server settings and another for the credential settings.</p>

<p>So…In our case we would have static server settings for all the users/devices. My vision would be for the IT department to enter the server settings one time on each device and when users end their shift they would press a “log off” button which would remove the SIP credentials. When a new shift starts they would press a “log on” button which would present them with a “Username” and “password” screen. This “username” would simply be the SIP authorization name and the “password” would be the SIP secret.</p>

<p>Ideally the “settings” button would also be password protected to prevent users from messing up the server settings.</p>

<p>Anyone have thoughts on this?</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>To complete this feature, the best idea is to rely on csipsimple API.</p>

<p>CSipSimple is by design extensible and allow third party application (that have rights to do so), to configure sip accounts on the fly.</p>

<p>BTW, it would be absolutely possible to develop your own android app, that use CSipSimple API, ask user to enter his own credentials the morning for example (or based on any rule your app decide to use), and then just provide settings to csipsimple using csipsimple.
You can make your own build of csipsimple to avoid editing account from within csipsimple to ensure your employees do not get credentials of others employees. But I think that these modification should remain as light as possible to allow you to easily update the sip application without modifying your application.</p>

<p>About this api, you should have a look to the aidl of .api package of csipsimple. And have a look on android SDK how service binding works.</p>

<p>Also something that you may be interested in, I'm currently working on another big opensource project that would aim to do some locale/tasker feature : have some plugin in input to get conditions, and apply settings (from setting plugin) accordingly to these conditions.
This kind of app, may allow to do a lot of things. Obviously I do a setting plugin for csisimple. 
It should already allow for example to enable/disable some account depending on condition : for example a datetime range, or a wifi access point, or from google calendar events. (Maybe only this could solve your problem... if you put your employees days of work in google calendar it may allow to automatically switch to a given account when there is an event in google calendar).</p>

<p>If you need help on the CSipSimple API you can join csipsimple developper google group or mail be directly. I'll be pleased to help :)</p></markdown-widget>

....</p>

<p>What language are you speaking? LOL! I know that API stands for Application Plug In and that SDK stands for Software Development Kit but that is about as far as I go. :)</p>

<p>I have attempted to look into this but man I ain't got a clue.</p>

<p>So...I would be willing to pay to have a plug in created by an interested person. </p></markdown-widget>
