Except, no matter which option is toggled, the microphone makes a horrible screeching noise. The same phone running the stock LATAM 4.0.2 Rom works correctly.</p>

<p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Install CyanogenMod10 using Safestrap
2. Install CsipSimple and configure any account.
3. Select the ULAW codec as it is the only working codec on this device.
4. Place or receive a call via WiFi</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
The speaker works fine. The application works fine. The sound quality on the speaker is really clear. The microphone however produces a horrible screeching noise on the other sound.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Both CSipSimple from Play store and CSipSimple from Nightlies.

<p>The app supports 2 audio backend implementation. One use the efficient and new OpenSL-ES api. The problem is that not all ROM/manufacturer drivers supports it properly. So you can manually switch to the legacy "java/jni" implementation.</p>

<p>To do so switch to ExpertSettingMode in global settings (see the wiki page if needed)
Then in Media &gt; Audio troubleshooting you should see a "Audio implementation" option. Change it from OpenSL-ES to Java. </p>

<p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>It could be interesting to play with audio mic source and with the audio clock rate. Some Motorola devices are known to have specificities with clock rate and different microphones. </p></markdown-widget>

<p>Also, some others interesting tests you could do :
 * test with other simple voice recoding apps -- even if it's not streaming apps, it could be interesting to see if result is similar or different.
 * go in csipsimple settings, press menu and audio test. (it's a simple loopback test)
 * Try to enable the "Use mode api". It changes the audio mode and tries to put the phone audio layer in the same state than the one of a gsm call. (in this test, revert the clock rate to 8kHz or 16kHz).</p>

<p>I also forgot some remark about your first report. 
Saying that uLaw is the only codec supported on the device is not true. 
Actually csipsimple should support all codecs it propose. It's software codecs implemented inside the app, so all are supported. What could reduce the choice is what is supported by your sip provider (and in case they do media gateway instead of direct RTP).</p></markdown-widget>

Use mode API does not seem to help at all.</p>

<p>The Developers behind this cyanogen version have stated that Bluetooth
Audio does NOT yet work with the current version of Cyanogen in the phone.
Maybe it has something to do with this?</p>

<p>As for the codec stuff, allow me to clarify:
Yes, CSipSimple has a ton of codecs. And I run Asterisk as the SIP server
so i can control which codecs i am using.
Regularly, my VoIP network uses ALAW,ULAW,Speex or GSM. With my normal
phone clients, all of these work just fine.
However, with my phone, NONE of these codecs produces ANY audio except
ULAW.  IT seems like it is a bug in the OS. more than a bug in your
software...</p>

<p>But it would be easier to raise a bug with Cyanogen if i know which part to
complain about!</p></markdown-widget>

Ok, you're right probably something on the audio layer rather than a problem with codec for the horrible noise part.
Bluetooth point could be something interesting to investigate. Is bluetooth enabled in settings? Even if no device is paired, the simple fact it's enabled can have an impact on audio layer of android. If you ask I think it's something to search in the audio driver integration. It's probably not something on Cyanogen but rather for guys that do integration of cyanogen on this device.</p>

<p>As the loopback test doesn't involves encoders/decoders nor network so it's necessarily something on the android audio layer. 
Either in csipsimple/its config or in the CM driver. As it seems an experimental rom and you have no improvements with all workaround settings I would think about something in the ROM, but I could be wrong. Unfortunately only guys from the rom could help to point me where I'm wrong if so. (Or having a device to directly test on and see if it's missing frames or have some advanced debug traces on audio layer).
Some setting I maybe forgot to mention that could help too : "setup audio before init". Normally it's now by default cyanogen roms friendly but maybe in this particular version for razr it should be inverted.</p>

<p>Some follow up about codecs issue too. It's another problem but you might be interested in that point too. It sounds to me something with negotiation of codec (and update to fix one codec not taken into account by server). I think that activating only one of the codec supported by the server do the trick. Whatever the one you choose. The important point is to get only one. Usually if the sip server is impacted by this not correct support of the codec selection update; symptoms are :
 - one way audio (server -&gt; you) 
 - this only happens for outgoing calls (incoming calls should work fine as the app is the one that selects the codec and can choose the preferred one)
If was your symptoms about horrible noise problem, it's maybe why you had to enable only ULAW ;). 
But anyway, other codecs will not help with your current problem as it's only here at audio layer level. </p></markdown-widget>

Since the bug keeps coming up every now and then, i begun a slightly
scientific debugging process.
I have identified the file that's causing the problems as
system/frameworks/telephony-common.jar
The stock CM10 build has a "new" telephony class that works with CSip in
Spyder devices, but not with Mobile Data.
Conversely, using the "stock" telephony in the rom makes Csip work (of
course, sometimes a reboot is necessary to clear out the screeching
noises), but not mobile data.
I'm including both links, to the rom and the telephony jar, maybe you can
make heads or tails out of this.</p>
