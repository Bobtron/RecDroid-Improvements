                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>So, in fact when I write "native sip" I mean using a native sip library (which is faster than a java stack like in sipdroid).</p>

<p>For your first point, the in-application dialer is here for a good reason :
For example if you don't want csipsimple to be integrated in native dialer: There is an option in Menu&gt; Settings &gt;  User Interface... &gt; Activate integration to choose if you want or not use the native dialer integration.
Beside user interface is not yet finished. (Remember, this is still an alpha version !)
There is also an option in user interface option to choose to start with the text dialer interface (for now a little bit buggy since you have to quit the app and restart it to make the change valid).</p>

<p>For your second point, it's technically impossible to use the calls UI from the standard android telephony interface. What I did is reuse code for both dialer and in call interface from the android git source code. But I planned that third party application can override theses view by customizing it with other themed versions.
Besides of the technical limitation, the in call interface of sip call is necessarily different from a GSM call, features such as conference etc etc are different between sip calls and gsm calls.</p>

<p>For your last point I'm really interested in a scenario to reproduce the issue.</p>

<p>For now, the current implementation search in your contacts if any of them has a number that matches the username field of the sip address (DisplayName ). If "username" match <em>exactly</em> one of your contacts phone numbers it will display his picture and his name (this search is done asynchronously so it first display a blank picture and DisplayName or username if looks like a phone number or fill sip address).</p>

<p>There is maybe issues with some specific contact phone number. This part was not fully tested, for example maybe phones numbers that start by a "+" are not well supported etc etc. So a more detailed description of this particular issue could help me to find out what is wrong.</p>

<p>As I answered the two first point, I change the issue title to track the last point. I wait for more details to be able to start this point.
Thanks in advance.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Why is it technically impossible ?  Is it simply because of a lack of an API ?
Is the UI encrypted code ? If the carrier link could be replaced by a SIP link it would solve a lot of lingering issues.  eg: lack of bluetooth functionality, perfect call record keeping, etc.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well, I try to explain this point a little bit more.
The more important thing to understand is that the telephony application is an application that aim to manage GSM / CDMA calls. And not sip calls. Sip call management is different from GSM/CDMA calls management. Just read the code of the android <em>standard</em> application : <a href="http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/packages/apps/Phone.git;a=tree;f=src/com/android/phone;h=9b6b2b6d778c2d6d178953bec89ff6d18c192584;hb=HEAD">http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/packages/apps/Phone.git;a=tree;f=src/com/android/phone;h=9b6b2b6d778c2d6d178953bec89ff6d18c192584;hb=HEAD</a> and you'll maybe understand where the problem is.</p>

<p>I have reused a lot of this code but :
* Everything can not be reused due to the fact this is done to manage cdma/gsm calls
* Theses phone applications use private APIs (which are known but that we should not use see next point).
* Each phone manufacturer can rewrite his own phone application and manage sound, device etc etc differently. So official audio api should be use
* Some device has no phone application
* Phone application doesn't provide API at a detailed level (and that make absolutely sens)</p>

<p>Just read the android git code, if you understand java and has some skills in android development you'll understand a lot of things. 
Else just trust me ;) : reusing code and take inspiration of what is done in the android open source project is possible (and is already done). But use the in-call UI from the standard android phone interface make no sens.</p></markdown-widget>

However then again it doesn't fill the current need nor does it save users time/money when making and receiving calls. Right now there is no solution, and atleast something is better than nothing.</p>

<p>So i propose the following once cSip is brought to its first stable release.</p>

<p>Split the project into 4 two part sections.</p>

<p>cSipSimple Remote - Which would be cSipSimple in its current form with developer support.</p>

<p>cSipSimple Local - Which would interact with the original phone api .
And which has the ultimate goal of filling the need to solve the underlying issues.</p>

<p>Both branch and trunk builds  (Stable and Alpha)</p>

<p>I understand the reasoning for taking a proactive approach to development however we should try to take a reasonable approach to development as well. Understanding that getting solutions into the hands of consumers ultimately helping conserve energy that would lead to protecting the environment should always be the top goal.</p>

<p>We need to look at this as well, it might be months or even quarters/years before a backwards compatible bluetooth solution is ratified without direct UI integration.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Your "cSipSimple local branch" is just impossible : I mean technically impossible.
Try to write some code and you'll see.
You think that if it was possible all other android sip application had also re-implemented their own in-call views?</p>

<p>As far as I understand, what you'd like is something absolutely integrated within a custom rom's phone app.
(I've seen your issue on cyanogenmod - and I think that CSipSimple is not yet enough mature to be integrated for a daily use -)
But well, I think that what you want is just CSipSimple becoming more stable and full featured. 
The "original phone api" - which doesn't exist as you think it is - will not solve this issue at all.</p>

<p>Don't worry I know exactly were I want to go, and I'm still far to have reached my goal. What I deliver is an <em>alpha</em> version just for tests. Even, when it will be a beta and the first stable version will not include all features. This is not a proprietary software and it will live grow, add features and improvements for years (at least I hope :) )! 
Besides, a custom rom integration (as the representation you have of it) is not a good idea to integrate directly to the phone app. 
There is many technical reason for that and also reasons linked to the project management (merge with both updates from the android git and the csipsimple svn is unbelievable. Imagine, when I will implement the transfer call, hold call and multiple call management... how to merge with a version totally rewritten within the native phone application? And what about voice mail integration, and features that are not present in GSM/CDMA calls but present in SIP. And what about when IMS, 4G, LTE will appear in android?...</p>

<p>If it's just the Bluetooth that afraid you, I'll reassure you my think is that it should take about 1 or 2 week to be implemented in the current version of csipsimple (provided the fact I own a bluetooth handset to test on... ). The android api is not so complicated on this point.</p>

<p>Regarding the proactive approach from development or user.... You know, I'm a child of opensource projects such as Blender, Firefox etc etc. 
And CSipsimple is an opensource project. I code only for my pleasure, there is no commercial engagement. The backward effect is that priority is given to the feature contributors of the project want to give time. But if a feature is worth to be implemented, be sure that there will be contributors that will implement it.</p>

<p>I try to take into account all request and suggestion from users since I think they are really important and will make the app provide a better user experience. But let developer choose what they want to develop. Else each code contributor will stop developing if that's not a pleasure to develop but a task asked by somebody and they don't really need it and you'll have nothing....</p>

<p>Besides please, don't say me how to code and design the app (OR code it yourself ;) and contribute !!! ). </p>

<p>If you prefer to pay for having exactly what you want and don't want to code anything, opensource model is not for you and you should use some proprietary application : 
Ask some enterprise to code the application for you, but I ensure you that price will not be the same and probably you'll not have features that you never though to.</p>

<p>P.S. : sorry for the spamming Alessandro, not really related to your first issue. But this point is probably important to clarify.</p></markdown-widget>

In fact, I had a test that check if username is a phone number before searching into contacts. r187 is now more permissive and will search even if contact uid contains +, *, #, -, ( and ). Besides if contact uid lookup fails, it tries with display name.
Code has been factorized to be used by Ringer and by InCallInfo class. (Should probably be used for CallLogs too).</p>

<p>@egcrosser : fuzzy matching is probably not really easy to do since we use a fixed api provided by android to lookup into contacts.
I've not read how it's done inside the android code on this subject. Maybe fuzzy search is already done... But as for now (thanks to Bob), what I can affirm is that contact lookup in csipsimple will not be worse than the official GSM telephony application of android (since they also relies on the same api). The only thing we can fail for is either not trying to do the search (my guilty fault) or not finding out the good thing to search provided the sip From header (and has just been improved).</p></markdown-widget>
