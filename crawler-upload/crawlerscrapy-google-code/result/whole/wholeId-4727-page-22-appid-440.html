<p>If you use APIs that are not available in android 1.5 or 1.6, try to create a wrapper to avoid crashes on 1.5/1.6 devices.</p>

<p>Here is a very interesting article on that point :
<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/04/backward-compatibility-for-android.html">http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/04/backward-compatibility-for-android.html</a>
For now I've only used the reflection method, but wrapping class can be a better way for the current Bluetooth case.</p>

<p>If you want, I can take this point later once you'll get things working on api level 5 and more.</p></markdown-widget>

Supporting both both 2.2 and older devices was a bit of a pain though and forced me to do it more complicated then I had originally expected. Interacting with other applications such as the media player seems very unpredictable even if you follow the recommendations.</p>

<p>I noticed that the standard phonecall handler just mutes the microphone when the headset button is pressed during a call instead of hanging up. This is not really the behaviour that I would like, however since it is how the standard phone app does it I think it should be the default behaviour. So I will add a setting before I check in to choose if csipsimple should hangup or mute on headset button presses during calls.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>So priority has simply to be changed and works for me.
with intentFilter.setPriority(IntentFilter.SYSTEM_HIGH_PRIORITY +1 ); instead of high priority intentFilter.setPriority(IntentFilter.SYSTEM_HIGH_PRIORITY - 1 ); is enough to fix the problem on my device.
You'll probably say that setPriority should not be higher than system_high_priority... but if we consider that we are replacing a native behavior... it make sense. I think that SYSTEM_HIGH_PRIORITY is just a value in the documentation to advise developer to not override native behaviors.
Btw, the new API could be a solution too, but it's really simplier this way.</p>

<p>Micheal can you test on your device replacing the priority in UAStateReceiver from -1 to +1 (or you can try with + 100 if it doesn't work with +1 ). 
At least on my device, it was not working anymore with -1 (but when I push the commit I'm pretty sure that it was working). With +1 it works fine now.</p>

<p>Else if it doesnt work I will make a switch that use new api and reuse the same intent receiver if API &gt;= 8 (as it is done in the official music app).</p></markdown-widget>

<p><a href="http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/frameworks/base.git;a=blob;f=media/java/android/media/AudioService.java#l307">http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/frameworks/base.git;a=blob;f=media/java/android/media/AudioService.java#l307</a></p>

<p>However, I'm not really confident on how priorities higher than the max priority are handled. Good side using old api is that it's absolutely not intrusive on other applications. If button should be handled by csispimple we abort the intent, else we just let other apps (or the registeredMediaButton) handle it.
Well, I should probably reuse the new api when possible using reflection to ensure it works with 1.5 devices too.</p></markdown-widget>

Should be safe to backward compatibility and in 2.2 mode will catch media button events only if necessary. Let me know if it's more stable for you now (tested on my N1 2.2 with official headset and works). Looks like your previous implementation now (excepted the fact it's splited in another unique broadcast receiver that is registered using api level 3 or 8)</p>
