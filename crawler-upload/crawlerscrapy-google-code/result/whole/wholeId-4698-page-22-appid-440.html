Make 3G call.  Move towards WiFi router until in range.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Ideally, call should continue over 3G until finished preventing WiFi from taking over.  Perhaps disable WiFi during 3G calls, although that might conflict with my Y5 Battery Saver or similar.  Even better would be to forward call to WiFi interface once connection made.</p>

There is some piece of code that already re-register each time network is changed.
But never tested. Probably something to be deeply tested.
I think that there is a brief instant while there is no connection available at all. And so, the sip stack just teardown instead of staying connected and waiting a while for a new connection (that will allow, just by re-registration to update voice path sending the good new sdp offers).</p>

<p>Maybe difficult to test for me (my gsm provider block 3G SIP calls). But will try with wifi to another wifi spot. (Maybe same the thing can be observed). Or if Bob or Micheal want to take the point, they would be welcome.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>My first comment was wrong (I didn't remember this article very well since).
The good way seems to be stop the stack and then, restart it. But as I previously said, I never tested it, and there is maybe consistency issues with the user interface.</p></markdown-widget>

However if you move out of wifi range (or switch it off) it doesn't switch back to 3g, as there's no connection to do handover.  I suppose the solution would be enable 3g when a call starts, having it ready for switch over if wifi connection drops below a certain level or fails.</p>

I didn't change anything on that point keeping my old method that just destroy the sip stack and start it again when connection is lost. (This is one of the solution proposed by pjsip guys - the other described by egcrosser is not fully working).
What is possible is that my method is not stable enough (probably the first time you get the issue it was a 3G -&gt; Wifi and this time 3G -&gt; Nothing -&gt; Wifi. (the nothing force the sip stack to restart).
I should probably do thing cleaner on that point. So I'll not close this issue yet, still work to do on it.</p>

<p>For your second point Wifi -&gt; No 3G I have this one sometimes too. Maybe linked to the fact an app keep a wifi lock (that's the case of csispimple while in call) or maybe keep some open sockets. So there is also clean things to do on that point to cleanly stop the stack when connection is lost.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Regis, </p>

<p>I have a few questions on the following works in PjSip and if it does how is it done in CSipSimple as I did not find any code references to it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Re-register with the new IP address when switching between 3g and WiFi (manually or moving in-out of coverage). </li>
<li>IP address change when on 3g. How do you get notified on IP address change  and what action do you take?</li>
<li>How to re-invite in the middle of a call with new IP address if WiFi becomes available and is in range for use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your answers with references to your code blocks are highly appreciated. I am studying your code to potentially do similar to what Keyyo-VoIP has done and want to make sure you have it all covered as those are some of the requirements that my product management is putting on me.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Perry</p></markdown-widget>
