<p>Problem is probably that you used the default "regexp" matcher for a replace rule.
However using regexp requires to be an expert in regexp (and you probably don't used regexp catchers parenthesis for a replace rule).
So just try with begin with or another pre-defined rule and you'll see that it will go better :).</p>

<p>Anyway I've fixed for robustness the issue if you enter an invalid regexp (available in latest dev build : 0.00-15-14).</p>

<p>I'll soon change the default from regexp to begin with.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The important thing to remember is that rules applies only to the stock android dialer (not the csipsimple one... we assume that on csipsimple you are dialing exactly what you want to send to the server).</p>

<p>Some quick example of what could be done with filtering/rewriting rules :
* rewrite entirely for example the voicemail number you can say that for example 123 is directly changed in **1 (if 123 is the number of your GSM voicemail and 123 the one of this sip provider).
* Ignore numbers that starts with 06 (in france that's mobile phone prefix), so if no sip account manage phones starting by 06 (all are configured with filters to ignore phones starting by 06) =&gt; 06xxxxx calls will direclty use GSM (and don't ask you for choice).
* Force numbers that starts with 04 (in france landline phones), so you'll not have the popup and it will directly call using this SIP account.
* Rewrite "+" sign into "00" many sip providers doesn't support "+" sign and prefer the standard prefix "00".</p>

<p>Of course, that's just examples and you can configure as you wish ;)</p></markdown-widget>

Just tried on my phone and it call directly using GSM as expected.</p>

<p>Just be really aware about that :
Filtering rules and rewriting rules works <em>ONLY</em> for native android stock dialer/contact application (or other app that does tel:).
It is <em>not working</em> for CSipSimple dialer since here I assume you know what you are dialing and you have the account chooser button at the right of the field that allow you to choose exactly what account you want to use for dialing that ! If you dial in the view that explicitly show you the account you want to choose, the client just obey you and dial what you ask him to dial ;)</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>There is no way to disable the account chooser button !</p>

<p>I'll try to explain the two points :</p>

<ul>
<li>As for integration with android :
-&gt; This enable the native dialer integration.
The rewriting and filtering rules applies only when you dial from the native dialer. And not from the CSipSimple dialer that already have an "account chooser button". Trying to explain in other words (my english is far to be perfect so maybe something with my previous explaination :) ) :
If you are in CSipSimple, as you have the account chooser button, I assume that you know exactly what you are doing and that you want to make a SIP call using the selecteed account.
If you are in the android native dialer (and android integration is activated in settings). You just want to make a call to somebody... Here filtering and rewriting rules applies ! That's logic, you never tell the system which SIP account it should choose ! You are just trying to make a call, and here the SIP application must be intelligent (and use rewriting and filtering rules) to guess what you really want to do! The system will show you (or not if configured to force call or ignore call) a popup with account lines to choose.</li>
</ul>

<p>To sum up : if you use CSipSimple dialer, you have the intelligence and dial properly and choose the outgoing account using the account button. If you use the native dialer (or click on make call on the contact), CSipSimple try to be intelligent and guess what you want to dial out.</p>

<ul>
<li>For incoming / outgoing mode :
I guess that when you say I restart the app, you clic the "Disconnect button" in menu. 
If you are configured in "available for incoming" mode; there is a popup .... read it... it explains you that by disconnecting the app you turn off the incoming mode !!!! Again that's logic ! If I still left the incoming mode here, what will happen... the app will try to restart it itself as soon as you network status changed. And besides how could you be in incoming mode if the app is actually stopped? So I had two solutions : 

<ul><li>Hide the disconnect button.... well, a lot of users that doesn't understand that incoming mode and disconnect the app is not compatible complains cause they think there is no way to stop the app... (indeed, they configured it to receive calls...)</li>
<li>The actual method where I show the button, but show a popup if you are configured in available mode saying that I will remove the available for incoming mode.... Well if here user doesn't read the popup... I don't know now what I can do to do something more understandable by users !</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope that make things more clear for you.
If you have any suggestion to make things more clear for users, do not hesitate I'm open to suggestions.</p></markdown-widget>
