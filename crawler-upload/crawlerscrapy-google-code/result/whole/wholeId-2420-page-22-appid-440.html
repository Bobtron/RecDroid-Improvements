If you want to announce bandwidth info from csipsimple you have to enable that in settings (it's by default disabled because some sip providers doesn't parse SDP correctly and gets broken when sent).
To enable it :
go in menu &gt; settings &gt; menu &gt; 'Expert mode'
once enabled, go in network section &gt; sip protocol &gt; Enable the add tias fields ... (rfc 3890).</p>

<p>However, I'm not sure it's the problem.
Apparently you are not using same network conditions in both tests. To be able to help I would also be interested in logs from the app (see HowToCollectLogs) it comes with what the app see, the rtcp stats, the model of the device etc. I would also be interested how you mesure jitter? Is that the network jitter infos from the app info view?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>[10:54] &lt;@bkw_&gt; jitter:  did you check the time stamps on the RTP?
[10:54] &lt;@bkw_&gt; I suspect its saying one thing but doing another
[10:54] &lt;@bkw_&gt; just based on what I was reading in your report
[10:55] &lt;@bkw_&gt; its not the first time we've seen that, SPA devices do 20 but clock at 30, and thats just broken, asterisk doesn't bitch about that either.
[10:56] &lt;@bkw_&gt; when you say 20ms DO 20ms, don't send 20ms of audio but increment your timestamps like you're clocking 30ms
[10:56] &lt;@bkw_&gt; we've seen all kinds of fun in this area
[10:56] &lt;@bkw_&gt; Sonus is by far the biggest offender of doing the wrong thing.</p></markdown-widget>

Please upgrade it to latest stable : <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/stable/1.00.00/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/stable/1.00.00/</a>.
If you cn produce same logs but with the stable version it will be interesting.</p>

<p>Then about rtp timestamps. They are absolutely right for the Opus codec implementation. This implementation is currently under dev and I don't advise people to use it yet unless they are under some constrained conditions.
There is maybe another codec that has been recently modified to use webRTC codec implementation and might be buggy, it's iLBC. So if you are using one of these codecs it could be the case and could be the root cause.</p>

<p>However, it's not the case for all other codecs and it should behaves exactly the same way other pjsip based sip client does (microsip is a pjsip based sip client).
An AFAIK it's not buggy with freeswitch (I use to do my test with this server on the other side which is the easiest to configure and the most stable ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Some additional question to try to get more ideas of what could be the problem : did you try with PCMU or PCMA codec?
If the csipsimple is the callee instead of the caller, is the behavior the same (or is the problem reversed?). 
When the ringtone is played on csipsimple side do you have a weird sound or is it good sound?
Is the problem symetric? (is the sound good in one way while bad in the other way?).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>@neerajnagi :
Wahouh... I was writing a very long comment and when it comes to advise about testing the audio layer of the app independently from the network/server... I started wondering what is the device you use...Thanks to the fact I write the device in the user agent, the device you use.... I see 'generic'... usually it means you use emulator ! Is it the case????
If so, stop searching... it's the root cause !!!
<em>Never</em> use the emulator with a sip client ! The audio stack of qemu is terrible. You are even lucky the ui is not completely frozen. This is known from long long time (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=125#c3">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=125#c3</a>).</p>

<p>If you are not using emulator, I would be very interested to know which device you are using. Because it's apparently a device that doesn't announce itself as a real device and has probably a bad audio layer implementation.</p>

<p>That's basically why the HowToCollectLogs real process send explicitly the device in the mail it produces.</p></markdown-widget>
