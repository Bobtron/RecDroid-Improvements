                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>CallCentric has suffered a major DDoS attack over the last two days. This has prevented many of us being able to register to their servers. As a result, they have published on their my.callcentric.com web site, new settings to use as a work-around.</p>

<p>The new settings involve the use of a Proxy server.  They have offered several proxies, two for clients that do DNS SRV lookups and a third for clients that do not support SRV lookups.</p>

<p>But with the new settings, while I am able to again register with CallCentric using CSipSimple, I cannot make calls.</p>

<p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1.  Change to new CallCentric settings.
2.  Attempt to make call.
3.  Receive either "404 / Not found" or "483 / Too many hops" errors.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Using the recommended CallCentric proxy for DNS SRV with SRV lookups enabled:
When Transport is forced to UDP, get "404 / Not found" error.
When Transport is set to Auto, get "483 / Too many hops" error.
All calls fail.</p>

<p>Using the alternate recommended CallCentric proxy for no DNS SRV and disabling use of SRV lookups in Network &gt;&gt; Settings:
Call appears to go through ok, but there is no audio.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Latest CSipSimple nightly.
Android ICS CyanogenMod (SpazeDog).
Phone is Nexus One.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I have a ticket open with CallCentric and have provided them with the complete set of CSipSimple settings.  Will report back here if they suggest anything useful.  In the meantime, if anyone here has suggestions, please post.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>To do so :
 - Create your account with callcentric wizard as usually
 - Save
 - Long press the row and choose "Change wizard" and select the "Advanced" wizard (in generic section)
 - Edit last field about proxy and set "srv.callcentric.com;hide" (take care that the ";" doesn't add an extra space).
 - Save. Go in settings (optionally ensure that DNS SRV is enabled in network settings), and press back twice. It should register. And you should be able to make calls.</p>

<p>A leave the issue open so that other users can find it. Also seems short term workaround so for now no need for me to change the wizard, but if they decide to make theses settings definitive I'll do.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Real security is never about hiding code/configuration. 
Opensource software like Linux, Firefox etc are good examples that better security is achieved by opening things and allowing everyone to review. </p>

<p>And in this particular case, even for a temporary workaround, anyone can have the information as soon as he create a free callcentric account. And there is many chances attackers had <em>at least</em> one ! I would be very surprised if not - all the more so as the kind of attack seems an not obvious one and means that the attackers have probably prepared it a lot and probably have created accounts. </p>

<p>Other point, if it's something with DNS involved into attack, I would advise to configure with IP rather than configuring with DNS name.
It will avoid dns resolution and so avoid any problem during this part.
So you can choose one of their IP (with the ;hide parameter). They have sip proxy servers IP, so just choose one randomly (if users doesn't choose all the same it should result in same thing that what results using DNS names).</p></markdown-widget>

Additionally, there's no proof that these issues won't reoccur. However, that helped me in making an important decision. Running my own SIP server. Since many of my colleagues are around the world, I can free calls internally, and register with ipkall for free DIDs, so that people from other networks can call me. I made my service public too, so you can freely register and use it: www.freelycall.com</p></markdown-widget>
