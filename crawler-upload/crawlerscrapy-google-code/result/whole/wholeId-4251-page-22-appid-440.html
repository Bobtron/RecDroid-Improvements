Sound is only getting through the Loudspeaker.
Same Problem was with Sipdroid.</p>

<p>Somebody fixed it like this:
On Orange San Francisco there problem seems to be related to not working am.setSpeakerphoneOn call. Old am.setMode call sets correct speaker. I am attaching my build with forced am.setMode call (and due to build problems commented some Bluetooth calls).</p>

<p>Problem in Sipdroid even with the fix: when switching to Loudspeaker, the MIC gets muted.
Maybe in CsipSimple it won't?</p>

<p>I would love to test it if you would be so kind to deliver a Fix for the Loudspeaker issue.</p>

<p>Csipsimple is awesome. But we really need this Fix for the ZTE Blade. So many people bought this awesome cheap phone.</p>

<p>Thank you so much!</p></markdown-widget>

(The setMode is part of these hacks).</p>

<p>To test it's pretty simple :</p>

<p>Activate ExpertSettingMode (wiki page, for global settings).
In media settings on the bottom you'll see some options about audio API.</p>

<p>The setMode hack can be activated by using "Use mode API".
If it doesn't help you can also try other settings in this part such as audio mode while in call (I guess that if it was fixed with setMode, you should try IN_CALL but it does the same that Use mode API (except that mode API turn IN_CALL for earpiece and NORMAL for speaker mode).</p>

<p>Let me know how it goes with these settings. If you find good settings, I'll be able to automatically turn it on for ZTE (I'll need the device id, but that's pretty simple to get, I'll explain you ;) )</p></markdown-widget>

There will be a nice donation on its way if we get this to work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is happening nothing when i click Expert-Mode. Everything stays the Same when i press it. No more Options.</p>

<p>Another Issue. When i hang up, it hangs up but time keeps on running an the Hang up button stays red.</p></markdown-widget>

But sound is not good. I hear a lot of cracks even my connection is ok. Sipdroid is much smoother compared.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok for delay observer, the problem comes from pbxes.org : they do not actually support TCP very well. So workaround is to for transport UDP in your account settings. (See ExpertSettingMode for account this time, and in transport choose UDP instead of Auto).
You can also install the latest dev version (see trunk nightly build link on home page of this website). By default I force UDP for pbxes.org.</p>

<p>For the cracks you observe, maybe the ZTE has the PSP issue.
I've also a workaround for that, so worth to try : in settings (I assume you are still in expert mode), go in User interface section and activate "Keep awake while in call".
If it helps let me know I'll also add it to the default settings for this device.</p>

<p>What it could be too, is something with codec : press the little (i) while in call and say me what codec you are using.</p>

<p>Last point, to add the default settings for the device I'll need logs from the device.
Can you follow instruction on wiki page : HowToCollectLogs . Thx in advance</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Wavs in Attachment.
We have the cracks issue left + Time keeps counting after Hangup or it says ringing but connection is established.</p>

<p>Cracks sound like csip cuts off the Ear piece / Loudspeaker.
Seems like it is getting better after a while. Bad cracks at the beginning, later on pretty good with almost no cracks.</p>

<p>TCP or UDP: does not matter
PCMU / PCMA Codec: does not matter (sipdroid uses PCMA so i even forced csip to use it)
8khz / 16khz: does not matter
Keep awake while...: does not matter</p>

<p>Proximity Sensor: shows a unlock and hang up slider instead of fading to black when using "keep awake"</p>

<p>Log attached with a choppy call.</p>

<p>THANKS a lot!</p></markdown-widget>

Actually your device has armv6 or lower CPU which doesn't support floating point CPU primitive. As iLBC implementation is a floating point one your CPU keep converting floating/fixed point which is pledge CPU. So do not activate it for your phone.</p>

<p>For craks maybe worth to try to deactivate Echo cancellation. And also try the latest trunk : <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a>  (I've changed buffer size maybe it can help on cheap devices).</p>

<p>For TCP/UDP, you really should switch to UDP (in logs I see TCP, and again pbxes.org doesn't support it properly). It will not improve media but for SIP signaling may help a lot. Pbxes.org develop sipdroid and their implementation of TCP is not standard (not follow SIP RFC). As consequence we have to fallback to UDP (and force it) with this provider. In logs you sent to me was still UDP.</p>

<p>I'll add zte to list of devices that need Audio mode API. Thx for logs.</p></markdown-widget>

Well logs are still without interesting contents.
Maybe if you can set debug level to 4 (5 is a little bit too much) and use aLogCat instead of my embedded tool (it's probably more reliable ;) ).

As if csipsimple was with debug level set to 1.

<p>The strange thing is that the first logs you sent to me contained logs from csipsimple so I assume not a problem from the device. Maybe a bad commit on my side.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>@dr.amerika : can you try to send logs with latest build (I've added some error log to be sure it will be traced.).</p>

<p>For dr.amerika ringing issue it's cause some sip server start to send audio while the SIP session is not "Confirmed" (It's useful for sending custom ringtone or things like that... some sip provider use that place to send audio from an attendant which is not a good idea cause the Sip dialog state is still "establishing" and the user may not pay attention to what is said.
Another explaination, is again, the UDP/TCP problem. I still guess there is some traffic that is trying to go through TCP and is not considered by your server. </p>

<p>Reason why I need sip logs to see where and how are send packets - there is maybe something wrong with my 'UDP' setting in expert account setting so that it's not taken into account on your phone. The two symptoms (ringing state and can't end call are typical of TCP/UDP issue).</p>

<p>As consequence, maybe worth to start recording logs, then go in accounts, delete existing account, create a new account with basic wizard (by default now it create only UDP accounts) and then wait for registration and make a test call and finally send me logs.</p></markdown-widget>

Tried a different beta-2.1-rom (maybe with a different kernel). Worked fine with that Firmware. Hung up just like it should right after the call ended.</p>

The problem with log sounds like if the native library can't access some native primitive (for logging in this case). I fear that it could go the same with some very low native interfaces such as socket networking.
Where do you get alternate ROM? Is there some forums so that I can read the code and the diff with opensource android code. There is maybe some specific changes done in the ROM that break standard native library and standard NDK compatibility (if so it's risky cause other apps that use native libs may fail too :S )</p></markdown-widget>
