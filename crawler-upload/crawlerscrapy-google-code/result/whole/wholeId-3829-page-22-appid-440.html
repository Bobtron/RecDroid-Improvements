                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Normally it's not linked to the support multiple call option. This one is about something that is done on the top of the sip stack and your issue sounds to me more related to the sip stack itself (pjsip) or its configuration (I mean even the configuration I do in the application space).</p>

<p>Your problem could be linked to the fact the more recent versions also create some "local account" for SIP to SIP calls. This is done automatically and is not configurable.
Previously the only account known by the sip stack was the one you configured. However it produced several problems.
As consequence, as it's advised by pjsip stack I created automatically two accounts one for TCP and one for UDP for inbound sip calls.</p>

<p>When some call reach the pjsip stack, it tries to detect the account this call comes from. And then once it knows from which account it comes, apply the account settings to the reply (specially the contact header).</p>

<p>If it comes from the register socket it should be obvious (to say the truth I didn't deep really in this part of code but I guess it should work in this case). 
If it comes from somewhere else (even the one of your server itself that bind the local bindings of pjsip), it's less obvious and the stack has to inspect what is sent in the invite to try to detect from where it comes.
In this case usually headers of the INVITE are usefull to detect either via or the other contact and so on (again I don't know exactly how pjsip detect that but it tries to do).
If none of the accounts match (probably your case), it take the fallback account which is the local one. And communicate with your remote party as if it was a direct sip call and in this case no username.</p>

<p>If you want to send me logs (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page) I'll be able to investigate a little bit more deeper why pjsip does not retrieve your remote party as belonging to a sip account and maybe propose a workaround for this kind of case.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in fact the problem should be solved more on the other side than on csipsimple side.</p>

<p>Here is how it should work :
CSipSimple register to the registrar with the ID 4699@registrar_ip_or_domain.
When somebody tries to call 4699 it has to call 4699@registrar_ip_or_domain.
and in consequence the to header must contain 4699@regisistrar_ip_or_domain and pjsip will understand this comes from what it has previously registered and detect it's this account cause the account id matches the To field.</p>

<p>In your case the remote party does not call 4699@registrar_ip_or_domain but 4699@phone_ip. </p>

<p>It works with csipsimple cause csipsimple has a local account that listen locally on the phone. (it allow sip to sip direct calls). In this case no matter of the 4699 in fact cause for csipsimple the account id is just sip:phone_ip (obviously no need of username here cause it's a client and there is only one user on it).</p>

<p>This kind of case could be linked to either the remote party or the configuration of your sip registrar/server.</p>

<p>I don't know what is the IP of your sip server but I guess it's the xxx.xxx.xxx.1 . If so it would mean that it transmit INVITE requests without taking into account a sip domain but just considering sip ua.
So it could be something linked to the sip server config itself.</p>

<p>Or second possiblity it could be linked to your remote party (if your remote party has the xxx.xxx.xxx.1 IP). In this case it's cause this remote party uses the phone IP instead of the registrar IP (I guess all your conf is about IP and there is no domains). 
Normally the remote party should dial sip:4699@registrar_ip but here it calls 4699@phone_ip. 
Obviously in this case no need of registrar ;) and pjsip considers it comes from a direct sip to sip call and replies as it should with the local account instead of the one it has registered. </p>

<p>It make sense cause from the point of view of pjsip, the other side does not need the registrar cause the incoming invite is done as if it waas a sip to sip client call.</p></markdown-widget>
