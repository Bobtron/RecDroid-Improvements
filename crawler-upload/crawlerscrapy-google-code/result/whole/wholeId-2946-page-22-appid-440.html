If your "local" account is a basic with ip set to 127.0.0.1, it could be normal that you get the caller@your_ip_address since it's probably what the sip server at 127.0.0.1 gives as information to CSipSimple.</p>

<p>If by "local" you mean the local account created with local wizard. And that you reach directly the application (without using a sip server proxy in the middle), it's very weird. And I will need some logs (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page), in order to find a clue on why CSipSimple get the incorrect address.
I just did some tests with that (to be sure), but on my side it correctly display the correct remote ip. (depending on which client I use on remote side it shows remote_user@remote_ip or just "sip:remote_ip" (which is also valid as sip contact).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>In comment #2, why in twinkle you add an account with the IP of the remote part????
Just add as account the IP of the twinkle PC.</p>

<p>In your case in point 3 of comment 2, the correct setting is 
"add caccount qqq@192.168.99.2" !! </p>

<p>If you announce as account the .9.... it's just logic that csipsimple get as contact the account with .9. 
Try to change your twinkle account, you'll see it works just fine (I use it very often for my tests) and BTW it's a valid configuration while referencing a remote IP address in twinkle configuration when you want a local account in twinkle is wrong.</p>

<p>I'm even very surprised that you get the call established for more than 30sec because CSipSimple should not be able to find the route to twinkle to send the final invite and should timeout.</p>

<p>So as for your comment #2, it's absolutely logic that you get qqq@192.168.99.9 ... because you actually configured Twinkle to send that !!!! 
Also in twinkle if you configure properly as a local account for twinkle (I mean with the IP of the PC), you have to dial www@192.168.99.9 to reach csipsimple (because obviously in this case, you need to specify the IP of the other sip client you want to reach) and not just www.
Doing this clean configuration, you'll also be able to call a second client running on ip 192.168.99.10 by calling in twinkle zzzz@192.168.99.10</p>

<p>About the point 2, is that something you actually tested? If you setup 2 local accounts on two CSipSimple, normally it will display you the remote IP. In fact even without username because it's strict. It will display you as call log and as incoming call sip:REMOTE_IP</p>

<p>I think that you get confused with the Twinkle configuration. If you use two csipsimple (that does a proper local configuration and is not based on wrong input of the local IP address), it will just work properly.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>But in any case it looks like I can remotely cause CSipSimple to show "" is calling and successfully start a call (normal, working, stays for &gt; 30 seconds), probably impersonating someone (the only clue is that it shows my local's account name; nothing if the local account is not created). </p>

<p>I have just experimented that it is working. So know your IP address =&gt; can call you with arbitrary caller's name. Is that insecurity inherent in SIP or CSipSimple can do something about that.</p>

<p>Probably such "direct IP" calls should be visibly different than normal calls mediated by SIP server.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>It's SIP... and the difference between From and Contact header fields.</p>

<p>Consider this situation :</p>

<p>You + a SIP registrar.
You configure that app to use the server <em>only</em> as registrar (not as proxy).</p>

<p>This is valid a valid SIP topology. 
When you'll call using this "account", you'll transmit to the remote side your "From" registered as the SIP address you are registered on the SIP registrar (so that the remote part will be able to contact you back whatever your current IP address). 
In this case you don't need to use the registrar as proxy to send the SIP packet. So no way the other side knows your registrar IP address else than with the From.
So here, you send as From requestor your "public registered sip address". </p>

<p>However, there is actually a way for the application to retrieve the actual "remote" IP address, but it should not use it for user display. 
Simple reason for that : it could be the raw IP of the last b2bua between you and the REAL remote part. So it makes no sense display that. </p>

<p>In fact in your Twinkle configuration of comment 2 here's what you are telling to twinkle to do :
"Twinkle please create an account that is announced as sip:qqq@192.168.99.9"
And it does. And actually.... if you have a look to twinkle logs... you'll see that it tries to register on 192.168.99.9 !!! And I guess that csipsimple doesn't accept this registration ;).
Then, when you call, what it does? Very simple... you didn't configured proxy.. so it takes the domain of the account '192.168.99.9' and adds the text you put in front ww... So you are calling "sip:ww@192.168.99.9"
And this is allowed by twinkle...because just like csipsimple the transport is there, shared by all accounts (even not registered ones) and is valid for calls.</p>

<p>Here, it does a direct call using no proxy, just like csipsimple does when you don't configure a proxy in expert setting mode, or just like it does when you use local account (but with local account I make sure that I annonce the correct IP address... unlike twinkle that just takes what you configured that is not necessarily valid !)</p>

<p>Then, about ~security~... Not sure it's really security you talking about but more something on how to be sure who's calling is actually the one announced... well first you have to remind that on landline calls, it's exactly the same problem and that the caller id is something that can be changed or hidden.</p>

<p>Besides, something you probably don't know... but on very low transport layer it's not a big deal to take the IP of somebody else.... so if at transport level it's not reliable... how could it be at application level ?!?</p>

<p>When you think about security you should go very deep to understand where is the root problem. 
If you see something at a very high level that rely on lower level by design not secure it's pointless to talk or try to fix the security issue on the higher level keeping security based on the same unsafe low level discriminent.</p>

<p>If you are looking for real security there is other ways much better and that are normlized like SIP over TLS, ZRTP etc.
SIP over TLS requires a topology and servers (it's for control plan)
ZRTP is used for media and can ensure that there is no man in the middle attack.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Yes SIP protocol is one very complicate. It allows a lot of topologies and possible configurations but it makes it very complicate to configure. The good side is that most things are possible with that. 
It's just about configuration then ;).</p>

<p>CSipSimple is based on a cross platform sip stack that respect very well sip protocol : it's pjsip. All done in CSipSimple is just to adapt it to android but that's just about integration. But everything related to SIP transactions are made by pjsip. Csipsimple just decides when to start and stop and fill the configuration from user input to pjsip stack.
I leave in CSipSimple an access to the sip stack with the expert settings in order to allow to address all configurations possible. 
Side benefit of using a cross platform sip stack is that it's robust and works well regarding SIP specifications. For example problems that could be encountered by sipdroid that is just for android and so try to guess IP addresses can't be encountered with pjsip because it has a more consistent and documented behavior.</p>

<p>For the anecdote, I started CSipSimple because of this problem in sipdroid and because my patches was not considered as interesting by sipdroid guys that target more usage with their service (pbxes.org). That's why I started to work re-using pjsip stack that is robust and well documented ;)</p></markdown-widget>
