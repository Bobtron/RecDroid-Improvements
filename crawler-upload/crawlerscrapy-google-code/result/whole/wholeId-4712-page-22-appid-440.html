1. Make phone call using iLBC codec.
2. Confirm iLBC using info.
3. Hear garbled sound.  Other end says sound ok, (not fantastic)</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Can make out what is said (just), but it's stuttery.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
12-08 (although has existed since iLBC introduced) Nexus 2.2</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I've been hounding my provider over this thinking it was their end, as voicemail calls sound fine, but all outgoing calls stutter, garble bad.  But making the same calls using LinPhone (featureless android sip phone) sounded fine. </p></markdown-widget>

I have found by changing the media quality and clock rate, sometimes and only if I'm very lucky a call will sound ok.  Subsequent calls garble.</p>

<p>Sometimes quitting helps, but I haven't got a process that's guaranteed to work and I've been testing lots.  Suspect it's an initialisation issue, but app startup doesn't necessarily help.</p>

<p>Can also be due to the fact when late at start time (due to an extra use of cpu) it goes worse and worse after. (It's probably more the case when it's an outgoing call since call user interface is created in the same time than media stream).</p>

<p>I've just build a new version with optimized build flags. My test show that using my htc magic for example gsm codec go from unusable to something near to be good. Not got at all for ilbc with my g2 but maybe could be good with nexus one (not tested since with high cpu and that support ilbc I have only my nexus one).</p>

Just to test if it's due to a bad initialization of the audio layer is to try to enable bluetooth (even if you have no Bluetooth handset), then place a call and click on the bluetooth button.

If it goes better then, it's probably due to a bad initialization (or init while cpu is overloaded).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Before and now if GSM was in the list, the connection would skip over iLBC and go with GSM.  iLBC is only chosen if all other options are disabled, so I suspect I'm getting some kind of fallback connection.  Nonetheless, stick with 30ms, it's smaller, more supported and probably sounds better.</p>

So the result is effectively the same since you are still testing with 30ms instead of 20ms (that works really better).</p>

<p>There is probably a bug (/ incompatibility with buffer size) while using 30ms. I'll do more tests today and maybe ask support from pjsip guys.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>AFAIK, iLBC is disabled by default on HTC Hero. There is a good reason for that!
iLBC is not supported by "old" devices.
Let me explain :
iLBC opensource implementation (that we use), is a floating point implementation. As a consequence to have something efficient, the native library <em>must</em> be build with floating point instructions. It's impossible until armv7a (for example nexus one, galaxy s, etc). 
On HTC Hero (and all the old generation), there is no way to build in floating point. So application will keep transforming floating to non-floating datas which will overload cpu and make an horrible sound !</p>

<p>So, if iLBC is disabled by default on your phone... you should not use it ! Unless you have a big armv4 cpu (that's the reason why I didn't remove it from the armv4 build)... but usually it's not much more than 800mHz.</p></markdown-widget>

It will just be much more less performant.
By default it's disabled for non floating cpu and enable it for floating cpu. If somebody has a strong armv5 cpu... I must give hime a way to use iLBC ! 
Some armv5 goes up to 1.25gHz ! Not sure that in this case iLBC is really unusable !
In general mainstream users, will not go in those advanced settings. 
I think that if an advanced user goes in this settings and try to activate ... he will be disappointed first... then will search why it is so bad... and here ... we could add something on the documentation.
But I don't want to put limits to users. 
My approach is :</p>

<p>Something automatically well configured for mainstream users
Easy ways to configure their sip account for mainstream users
Mainstream users want an easy setting interface</p>

<p>BUT : ways for power users to tweak the app if they have particular needs.</p>

<p>User friendly but leaving the user free :)</p>

<p>Last note, regarding this remark : for now, I've still to separate things in settings and add an "advanced setting section", since many things here should not be proposed to mainstream users.</p></markdown-widget>
