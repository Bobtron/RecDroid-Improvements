                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>@punny : the aim of this issue was to implement the <em>standard</em> SMS way using MESSAGE.
Actually that does not <em>ONLY</em> do SMS. </p>

<p>It use SIP SIMPLE protocol to send MESSAGE. It could be used as chat messaging system. Some provider use this protocol to do the gateway between SIP MESSAGE and SMS of the mobile network.</p>

<p>All betamax clones support both MESSAGE and web api methods. Web api is a verry crappy way compared to a clean SIP MESSAGE ;). 
If your provider does not support SIP MESSAGE you really should ask them to do so. I'll never implement in CSipSimple a not normalized API specific to a provider. Only the normalized SIP MESSAGE way. CSipSimple is a sip application.
The support of SMS using SIP MESSAGE is already available in the application.</p>

<p>The task is entirely finished yet. level7systems and skhanzada are working on this point to improve the UI.</p>

<p>@Surie : there is probably something wrong I do with encoding. Can you open an new issue for that? I guess it's even possible to have the exact encoding from the message sent by the server but my code does not manage it (I guess that I assume it's utf8 which obviously could be wrong ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>By default csipsimple send using utf8 encoding. 
If the gateway of the sip provider does not support it, the guilt is more likely on the side of the server (the sip provider). This would be coherent with the fact they also have the problem on their web interface.</p>

<p>The only thing I could try on my side would be to explicitly add the encoding type to the mime type of what I send, but normally now all sip server should assume encoding is utf8 (unless that's old windows servers ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok.
So I think that what easyvoip do when receiving a SIP MESSAGE is just to apply raw ascii to what is sent encoded in utf8.</p>

<p>Normally all encoding stuff should be done by the gateway. It's never up to the SIP MESSAGE client to encode things in a special charset. The obvious very good reason is that the sip message client does not know that behind this will be tramsitted to the SMS network. Keep in mind that SIP messages can be exchanged between SIP clients, just like it's done for SIP calls. Here we are in front of SMS gateway. It's normally up to the gateway to do his job and to convert things.</p>

<p>It's a little bit like if it was required for a SIP client for voice calls to PSTN network to encode INVITE in a special way to be understood by the analog phone. That's not how things work, the gateway should do things to translate SIP signals to PSTN signals. Here, with SMS gateways, it should go the same.</p>

<p>The only thing I could try on my side is to specify that what is sent is text/plain;encoding=utf-8 instead of just text/plain, and then cross finger for :
 * the fact that it will not break things on most gateway that may implement things a crappy way expecting only for text/plain (without ";...."). 
 * the fact that it will be interpreted by easyvoip gateway, and that it will be converted correctly.</p>

<p>If you are ok, I could do a special build just to test this case by hard coding the extended mime-type. So that you could validate whether specifying encoding of sent text helps on easy-voip side helps. If so, I'll have some non regression tests to do in order to include that when talking to all sip servers and all sip clients.
As anyway I've planned to include the way to send something else than text/plain (for example to share pictures, or any mime type... cause that's allowed by SIP messages), it should will not be really a hack but could be considered as part of the feature enhancement about changing mime types of what is sent.</p></markdown-widget>
