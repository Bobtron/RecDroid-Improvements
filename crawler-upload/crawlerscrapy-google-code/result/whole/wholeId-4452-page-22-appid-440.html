The RTP packets are the most important ones since they carry the voice. Control packets are secondary in importance. I suspect the value of 24 (CS3) that you have previously mentioned is used for the control packets only and not for the RTP ones. I think there should be 2 DSCP values, one for the RTP packets, and one for the signaling that you probably already have.

<a href="https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/QoS">https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/QoS</a> 
On my side I simply use PJ_QOS_TYPE_VOICE (<a href="https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/QoS#Design">https://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/QoS#Design</a>) for RTP packets. That's the level of the API I can play with. I could go further inside the SIP stack, but I resent in doing that cause forking the stack code means painful merges between their improvements and CSipSimple branch.</p>

<p>So as for RTP packet, maybe I could add an option to switch between type VIDEO (0x28 - that's what you advised me previously), VOICE (0x30) &amp; type CONTROL (0x38). 
Do you think it would be enough or it would be better to have a finer control on the actual DSCP value for RTP packets?</p>

<p>Tagging with 24 SIP packets is done on all their example, that's the reason why I used for my first proposition.But you look like more an expert than pjsip devs on QoS stuff ;), reason why I'll adopt your proposition of 26.</p>

<p>I'll check why it doesn't take into account DSCP changes on my side.
Let me know if the setting for RTP should be enough and if it's important to set default RTP DSCP value to what pjsip stack call video (0x28) instead of audio (0x30)</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Keep it simple then. Avoid those painful merges and just leave it as is with simply a QoS on/off choice. Personally I am already happy that packets have some DSCP flags turned on, even with other values I do not use in my networks. It sounds a lot easier to me to simply, as a network admin, add a couple of lines and reclassify or change the RTP packets. If the sip stack doesn't give you an easy way to change RTP packets, then don't do it. From what you describe me it looks like pjsip's job to do that part. Leave it at 48 but their value is not a widely used one. It basically classifies the packets as internetwork control packets and I am not very sure why would their implementation have it like that. The DSCP value of 46 (0x2E) or also known as EF (Expedited Forwarding - RFC2598) or 184 (0xB8 as a full byte cisco-linksys/asterisk) if you prefer, is the one that warranties low jitter, low loss, low latency with guaranteed bandwidth which is exactly what you want for voice traffic and that is definitely the recommended one. I wouldn't recommend switching between Video and Voice as Video is another story and I am not sure I ever advised that. Video is of lower priority than Voice and you definitely don't want that for Voice packets.</p>

<p>As for the SIP/control packets, the difference between 24 and 26, is the drop probability. 26 has the lowest drop probability while 24 has a medium drop probability and again, you don't exactly care for a SIP/control packet when it will get there, as much as it <em>should</em> get there and setting DSCP to 26 gives the packet a better chance than 24 to get there without getting lost somewhere in between.</p>

<p>QoS could be a bit confusing and as I already mentioned, not every one has to follow the same approach. I have googled a really nice doc about QoS. You may want to have a look at it specially at part 2 - Marking and Classifying.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rhyshaden.com/qos.htm">http://www.rhyshaden.com/qos.htm</a></p>

<p>To sum it up, the ultimate approach would be to have two choices for the DSCP values, one for RTP packets and another second one for SIP/control packets. That way, you can adopt the app to any network setup you want. HOWEVER, I highly suspect it should be done through pjsip.</p>

<p>Hint: If both DSCP values are set to 0, it is the exact same thing as QoS set to off.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Indeed you're right for RTP packets that's done by pjsip stack. I was talking about audio and video type because that are the "type" the high level api allow me to set for RTP packets (for SIP control packets, I have to set the DSCP value).</p>

<p>I think that they give this high level API cause pjsip also support WMM &amp; IEEE 802.1p. In our case WMM is not supported and ieee is useless (unless maybe for some future wired android tablet...)</p>

<p>So I think that for now, I'll see what is going wrong for DSCP setting for SIP packets and change the label to precise that it applies to SIP packets and not to RTP ones - of course if the setting I try to change actually do something :) - else I'll remove the setting of DSCP value and ask on pjsip mailing list to see if they have any clue on that point.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As for one DSCP by account, unfortunately, not easy using pjsip. 
We could create different transport, but the configuration of CSipSimple will give headache to users. 
Actually in pjsip transports and accounts are two different things, and accounts use transport when they want to send something. We can attach a account to a transport or let the stack choose the best transport for what we are trying to do.</p>

<p>In order to keep thing simple I only create an UDP, a TCP (and in the future a TLS) transport, that all accounts can use.
I think that making one transport by account would be over-engineering for 99,9% of users.
Not only most users have only one account, but allowing to customize this kind of stuff by account would be extremely difficult to understand for mainstream users.</p>

<p>As for DSCP value for control packets, I've change default value from 24 to 26. For RTP DSCP marking, I think that I'll not change the value since it would mean to modify the pjsip library (which I try to do as less as possible).</p></markdown-widget>

<li><p>Have you a link to the RFC corresponding?
On my side I use those provided by default by pjsip (see <a href="http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/QoS">http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/QoS</a> )
Where in public it's specified that the value from cisco are the good one ? A standard is not something that is specified by only one manufacturer. This was the conception of Internet Exporer in the past. The real standards are those from W3C. Here it goes the same with SIP. Something implemented by one manufacturer is <em>never</em> a standard. A standard is something proposed to the rest of the world and then adopted and formalized by a third party community (such as IETF, ISO etc).
For now what I know of this TOS value : it is highly dependent on the equipment manufacturer and no one behaves the same way. (cisco, linsys, snom, aastra, grandstream... I just did a new search on google and found this one : <a href="http://kb.smartvox.co.uk/ip-phones/sip-configuration/voip-qos-settings-part-2/">http://kb.smartvox.co.uk/ip-phones/sip-configuration/voip-qos-settings-part-2/</a> )</p></li>
<li><p>You <em>CAN</em> configure the <em>values</em> you want in CSipSimple settings :D. It's already available since a while ;).
Just go in expert setting mode (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/ExpertSettingMode?wl=en">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/ExpertSettingMode?wl=en</a>). You can configure the SIP DSCP marking val and in account settings the per account RTP DSCP value.
No need to full restart csipsimple. Just enable the settings and set the values you wish; go out from the setting and it will be applied. If you notice it's not applied, check that you enabled QoS in settings, and send me wireshark + logs from the app (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page)</p></li>

<p>For the DSCP SIP value, it's just to revert to initial value that was present before comment #12 here. Can you review comment #12 from lefterists here (that I consider as the reference post here because explains well things) and tell me if it makes sense to you too ?
If so, and if I correctly understand the post, I should leave value 26 instead of 24 by default as ensures better packets will not be lost somewhere.</p>

<p>For the DSCP RTP value, after reviewing the code, there is indeed a problem, the default get the value from control layer values. 
I'll fix that right now to use 184.
Just one thing I'm puzzled with : in your comment I see decimal:46 (in hexa 46=0x2E) hexa:0xb8 (which gives me in decimal 184).
As your comment mixes the two values I'm a little bit confused on what you advise as default value exactly. In comment 12 (that mention the two values) it is more clear about the purpose of these values and (again if I correctly understand) I would say the good one is 184 (0xb8). Does that make sense for you too?</p></markdown-widget>

You can ignore the column I to K as they are L2 QoS.</p>

<p>ToS and DSCP are different as ToS uses all 8 bits in the header field and DSCP uses only the first 6 bits of it and ignore the rest of 2 bits.</p>

<p>General priority(0-7) is defined by only first 3 bits, and more specific priority for each priority is graded into 3 drop probabilities from Low to High by 3 bits from 4th bit to 6th bit.</p>

<p>So, if you talk about DSCP, you should pick up first 6bits, in this case it is "10 1110", which is 46 in decimal.
If you talk about ToS, it's "1011 10xx" that is 184 if you put 00 in the end.</p></markdown-widget>
