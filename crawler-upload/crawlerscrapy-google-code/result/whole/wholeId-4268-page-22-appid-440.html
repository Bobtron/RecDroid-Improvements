Something I'm wondering : </p>

<p>Seems that on the market my upgrade method (that download dynamically the best .so file according to the device), is not very stable.</p>

<p>Many error case and even if I did my best to have md5 sum and to ensure everything is good after download seems there is still problems.</p>

<p>As it gives a very bad user experience. I'm wondering if I should not distribute on the market a CSipSimple version with all .so files in it (just like devs version). 
The application size will be increased of course since for now we have only the necessary file downloaded but if I include armeabi + armeabi-v7a inside the app it will be bigger. (~+1.5Mo).
I don't know if it can be reduced then at run time. Sounds nobody tried that after some quick search on the web... but in worse case mean to have a bigger app size on the market place.</p>

<p>So my question : is application size important for users?</p>

<p>(P.S. : if necessary I can still distribute somewhere else than on the market some custom builds optimized for one CPU only).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>@fanderay &amp; dcitelecom : 
That's not so simple. As I stated if I package the native lib inside the .apk (what is distributed over the market) it's more reliable of course cause we rely on market download system which is specifically developped by google and is much more reliable that my class. (And I've no shame to say they did things by far better than mine class that download cause I remember first version of the android market plenty of bugs and... that's google ;) ).</p>

<p>So if I package things in the .apk.... it's impossible to remove files then. Package integrity seems to be checked by android and it's not possible to change it's content. Which in terms of security is a very good thing.
The bad side is that I'll have to package 3Mo of .so file in the .apk. Then the android system choose the good .so file and copy it in the "living" directory of the app so that it can access to that.</p>

<p>Currently my method is to package nothing on the .apk and then the app checks the device and """" simply """" download the correct version via URL link... But @dcitelecom : that's actually what I do and my current problem is that it does not seems to be reliable. At least less reliable that packaging it in the .apk like I do for nightly builds.</p>

<p>However there is hudge advantages to my method. The shame is that google doesn't provide a clean way to do what I try to implement. Cause with their method the space used by a native app is 3 times higher than with my method (which unfortunately is not reliable). Besides my method will allow me to do custom and tweaked builds. </p>

<p>For example for the future features such as video (which will not be compatible with android 1.5 devices) or such as new audio real time api (which will not be compatible with 2.2 devices)... 
For now, my question is just "is the app size something that could be important for users?".</p>

<p>Even if I distribute the .apk with bundled .so, of course I'll distribute light version, TLS version, armv4t version and so on. Maybe, also, if app size is really not a big deal for users, I'll also allow them to choose an optimized build (or a build with more features within the app --- in this case the app will eat another 1.5Mo)...</p>

<p>If that's a big deal I have to focus on my method... and if I focus on something I do not develop other features and you'll have to wait for video calls, for conferencing, for realtime audio api and so on.... That's the real sense of my poll ;).</p>

<p>I clearly know what are my technical options don't worry ;). 
So let me reformulate my question :
What will be more important for user decision to choose one or another app : 
* an application that doesn't consume too much memory (for now low = 2.8Mo vs heavy = 5.8Mo)
* Does not really matter they will prefer to have features. (and anyway if they really matter app size they will search over the web and find light versions).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>In your shoes I would hold off on new features and do only bug fixes until this issue is resolved. Your app already has more features than most other sip apps in the Android market place and it's not always about features. Stability and reliability are much more important than bloating the app with every imaginable feature e.g. Bria is simple and functional.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Finally, in a first time, before I make a full "library manager", I decided to release on the market a fat version. The nightly build server now build armeabi-v7a, armeabi and armv4 builds so it should be fine for size matters.
Besides I found a way to strip native lib size so that it's not so awful now... still less than the web-browser.</p>

<p>Goal in the future is to have something that allow to switch from a version with TLS enabled to a version without or a version with some codecs acivated etc. 
But this part of the app has to be reworked and be absolutely stable else users will be very sad about the feature.
But that should be considered as a feature for future releases. Priority goes to stability as dci said it's the first thing that is important for users.</p>

<p>Then as for the priority of this feature, regarding feedback I have for now users are much more interested video calls and multiple calls management. 
Video is really a "marketing" feature I think (don't know if it is really in usages to use video calls even on pc...) but as I'll enjoy to do that... i'll do it :)</p>
