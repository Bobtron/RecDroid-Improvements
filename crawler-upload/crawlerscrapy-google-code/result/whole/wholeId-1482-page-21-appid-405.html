<p>...its simple. Just like in any old phone (not smart phone) you go to the contacts
and then see the details of a contact and then send business card...</p>

<p>Lets say I wish to send contact details of guy Alpha to girl Zeda on my old phone
(Nokia, Sony Ericsson, anything...)</p>

<p>1) I go to my address book
2) Go to Alpha
3) (on my phone this is in details) Click on "Send Business Card"
4) (the phone comes up asking for phone number) I enter Zeda's phone number
5) Zeda gets an sms saying "Business card received. Add to Contacts?"
6) She clicks "yes" and the contact Alpha is added to her address book on phone.</p>

<p>I told my friends who have old un-smart phones to send me business card like this
(its typically in vcf format) and I did not get ANYTHING on my android. I can get
text sms however.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>I also just realize that my 'cool' HTC Hero phone can't do anything about Business 
card from Contacts. I suspect because Android contacts is in different format from 
common Mobile Phone contacts. This is a shame because I was replacing my trusty SE 
K510 to something very cool, but then something as simple as this Business card 
thingy won't work. :(</p>

<p>SMS is working, but not when sending Business Card. How do I know? I tried sending 3 
SMS (normal 'test' SMS, then Business card SMS, then another normal 'test' SMS) to 
multiple recipients (HTC Hero and SE K510) from Nokia phone (no smartphones, just 
common phones). My SE accept all three SMS, and asked "save contacts?" for the 
Business card. HTC Hero received the first and the third, but nothing about the 
second SMS. In short, Android just ignored (blacklisted?) SMS that contains Business 
Card. Not even an 'error' message. Even my old SE T68 can 'see' the Business Card 
SMS as text (showing "BEGIN:VCARD..."). I don't know if this is a bug from HTC, or 
is it caused by Android. I changed the SMS apk, including adding vcardIO, but the 
Business Card SMS is still got ignored by HTC Hero.</p>

<p>The Business Card vcard format is something like this:</p>

<p>BEGIN:VCARD
VERSION:2.1
N:family name;given name
TEL;VOICE;HOME:home landline phone number
TEL;VOICE;WORK:work landline phone number
TEL;CELL:mobile phone number
TEL;CELL;WORK:work mobile phone number
TEL;FAX:fax number
EMAIL:e-mail address
URL:homepage address
BDAY:date of birthday
NOTE:note text
END:VCARD</p>

<p>I hope this got cleared sometimes soon, because I want to be proud with my Android 
phone, but cannot because of this 'missing' feature.</p></markdown-widget>

I know that android does not handle the "business card" type of SMS, but android MUST
NOT hide that SMS message from the user. The user MUST be able to see the raw SMS
(sample provided above by nuhendra) -- that's how old SonyEricsson phones handle
"business cards" sent from Nokia devices. They don't recognize them as "special
business card" messages, but they at least show them to users. </p>
