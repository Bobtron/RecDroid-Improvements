<li><p>Sometimes when on wifi the DSL connection goes down but wifi is still up. In this case csip loses the registration but can't re-register on wifi because DSL is down. Why not switch to 3g at this point. I.e. have a failsafe registration mode. If app can't register or re-register on wifi, try 3g (if allowed) and vice versa.</p></li>

For point 2 : re-registration is done once directly after the registration loss and then each 5 minutes if you are in 'Always available mode' (of course). (P.S. : did you try just to deactivate/reactivate account, that's easier than going in settings and pressing back (and that only does an unregister while settings and back restart all the sip stack).</p>

<p>For point 3: unfortunately, on android, we don't choose which connection type we use. And we can't stop wifi. We can know what connection we are currently using but that's android os that choose the data connection. (And besides, when you are using wifi, 3G is automatically cut =&gt; 3G and WIFI can't live at the same time). As consequence there is nothing I can do for your issue. But all android apps are affected the same way than me : you'll not receive mail, you'll not be able to use gtalk...</p>

<p>For point 1 &amp; 2, if you can produce some logs could be interesting for me to see exactly what is happening (there is a wiki page about how to produce logs).</p></markdown-widget>

<li>You're right... But for most users I'm not sure it would be good idea : there is users that are not allowed to use 3G for Voip, the problem can come from the sip server, if there is another app that is downloading using wifi you'll break the download...
So as a default implementation I don't think cutting wifi is a good idea. However, it can be envisaged as an option for users (like you) that have an unstable wifi connection. But for now I'm more interested in doing it stable at least when condition are favorable (and as you noticed that's not always the case... the app is still in alpha developement ;) ). Once things will be fine when connections are stable, we will be able to build on the top of solid foundations.</li>

If csipsimple is connected via wifi and notices that something is wrong with the wifi connection, i.e. the DSL modem has lost DSL and sip loses registration then the wifi connection is obviously down and it makes no sense to maintain it at that point. You switch to 3g to re-register and check wifi every 15 minutes or so if the connection is back up. I don't is this can be coded but it's what I do manually when wifi Internet is down.

i've csipsimple configured to use wifi on incoming calls.

<p>the matter, is that i haven't found any way to make it connect from the csipsimple app.
including reconfiguring network settings, account, kill/restart app and even account delete/recreate.</p>

<p>the only way to get it to work - disable wifi (yes, system wide), and turn it on again.</p>

<p>Besides if you really want to be always available, in addition to CSipSimple settings to have "Lock wifi" (if you have 3g deactivated, it's automatically done if you choose "Always Available"); so in addition to that, you should change your device wifi sleep policy.
To do so; in <em>android</em> settings, in wifi settings, press menu and advanced setting. In sleep policy choose "Never".
As consequence even if wifi goes down (and if so CSipSimple release the wifi lock to avoid battery drain), the android system will continue to scan and retry to connect wifi even if screen is off.</p></markdown-widget>

when i have "network is unavailable" in csipsimple, i also can't make any download through a browser.
the downloads app is just stuck, and does nothing in that case.
But just with two exceptions, all other app, sync, browsers, resolve, ping/telnet in terminal etc. have an internet access and continue to work just fine.</p>

<p>Can I suppose, that csipsimple and downloads app use some api, not as common, unlike others do? And which got stuck from time to time in kernel for unknown reason.</p></markdown-widget>
