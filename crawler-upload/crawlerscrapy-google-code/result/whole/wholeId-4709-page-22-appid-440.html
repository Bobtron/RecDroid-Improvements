<p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
When i call or receive a call, the speaker is always on, so all people around me can listen my discussion ...</p>

CSipSimple_0.00-12.apk or CSipSimple_0.00-12-07.apk</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I tried to change speaker volume on csipsimple options (1 to 0.5, then to 0.1), but always the problem with the Galaxy S.
I tried to press on speaker button, the sound is higher.
(I also tried to press Mute button, and the personn called still hear me but it's another problem.)</p>

<p>So, as for your issue, audio api is not really easy to manage on all devices at the same time. That's the reason why some features such as audio routing is not so easy to do.
If you are interested to test for me on galaxy S, you can contact me directly by email (and in french if you want ;) - I'm also french). 
My mail is available in the "contact dev" section on the market or maybe visible here on googlecode (not sure).</p>

<p>So, I'll be able to send you custom builds to test speaker routing on galaxy S.</p></markdown-widget>

First of all, let me say that i found this app. CSIMPLE for SIP calls the best of SIP Softphones for Android.
Now, I use 2 SIP providers simoultaneously and when I make calls I have the same problem, the speaker is on and it do not turn off, so all the people around me are listening my conversation.
I have a SAMSUNG GALAXY Y S5360L with Android 2.3.6
The other great feature of CSimpple is the option to record a call, but the record is in WAV so few minutes gives a couple of MEGABYTES. So should be better to record in 3GP format, less megabytes and natural format for Android and less CPU usage.
Would be great to have your comments and fixes soon.
And thanks for the great, simple and with many features aplication.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi, you can try nightly build, the Galaxy Y needs a workaround to work (many samsung devices needs workarounds :) ). You can download nightly here : <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a>
It should auto-detect the device and set the correct workaround parameters.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can read the following issues and comments of users finding the workaround that works : 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?can=1&amp;q=1610&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary&amp;id=1610">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?can=1&amp;q=1610&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary&amp;id=1610</a></p>

<p>Apparently using "Mode api" workaround helps with latest dev versions.
Let me know how it goes (here or on issue 1610). I'm interested in feedback on device auto-detection I introduce in nightly builds before the next release.</p>

<p>About the record call feature, for now my approach regarding that is to advise to use a third party app that does that better (and may support more compression formats). 
I think that the best solution would be a third party plugin that does the conversion job at each end of call and convert (and could also rename) these files. It would also allow to play and share/archive this files. 
It's not the purpose of csipsimple to manage wav files, and a dedicated app could do so many cool things. Besides integrating such a management in CSipSimple would probably confuse users that don't need the feature, and would be restricted to be mainstream. While in a dedicated app, as many feature could be introduced to do many things with these wav files. So, I think that feature scope that could cover such an app is big enough to consider it can be a separate and dedicated app.</p>

<p>About the format, it indeed consume more disk space but it doesn't consume more CPU. During recording all packets that comes encoded (with whatever codec) are decoded to PCM format to be played on audio device. 
So it cost less to save that as raw pcm wav than to re-encode it in 3GP (AMR codec). As CPU consumption is critic during a call, it's a better solution to keep raw format rather than re-encoding it in another format.
Then during playing of the file, it doesn't necessary take more CPU to play a wav PCM file than a 3gp/AMR file. 
As far as I have read from android source code, AMR-NB/WB decoding is done by software (in libstagefright). And there is few chance samsung do that by hardware. The software decoder is very good however (it's the one I reuse for AMR-NB codec in CSipSimple), but it's still not hardware and may consume more CPU loops than PCM.</p>

<p>But disk usage is a sufficient reason to need something that transcode :)... I'm just saying that it should take place in a dedicated app, that would manage more things than just transcoding, and may provide a better user experience. </p></markdown-widget>
