<ol>
<li><p>Introduction</p>

<p>The same SIP [1] request can be issued for a variety of reasons.  For
example, a SIP CANCEL request can be issued if the call has completed
on another branch or was abandoned before answer.  While the protocol
and system behavior is the same in both cases, namely, alerting will
cease, the user interface may well differ.  In the second case, the
call may be logged as a missed call, while this would not be
appropriate if the call was picked up elsewhere.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>CSipSimple <em>does</em> log a call as having been missed, which RFC3326 describes as inappropriate, when the call has been picked up elsewhere.</p>

<p>The CANCEL message will contain a Reason header such as:
      Reason: SIP ;cause=200 ;text="Call completed elsewhere"</p>

<p>We should act on it accordingly.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Cancel is correctly supported by pjsip ;). Don't be worried about that ;). I think that the problem is elsewhere and more related to csipsimple than to the sip stack.</p>

<p>It's probably about double registration problem. 
Regarding my analysis the known problem of csipsimple that doesn't unregister after loss of connection and retrieve of connection. (well the fact it doesn't unregister when connection is lost is pretty normal... but the fact it doesn't try to unregister after restore connection is worse).</p>

<p>The server seems to be also culprit because it tries to send the cancel only to <em>one</em> of the registered user agent (the first and outdated one). And that's a server bug.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>After re-reading it I understand. You're absolutely right. No need of tcpdump. </p>

<p>I think that I know what's going on. I don't treat that correctly in CSipSimple. 
For now I only consider the simple call flow from UA point of view (for csipsimple disconnect + not answer =&gt; missed + unread) which is bad. 
I should have a look on how to get the info from pjsip instead. </p>

<p>I think that the correct behavior in this case would be to have =&gt; unanswered (same red incoming icon) + acknowledged (without notification). 
What do you think? I resent introducing a new icon to represent this particular case, but if you have an idea don't hesitate :).</p>

On my Samsung Galaxy S2, which is registered to a Fritzbox from outside, an incoming call, which has been taken somewhere else than on the Samsung, produces a hanging 'incoming call' screen. After one took the call on another device, the ringing stops, but the screen remains. For a while, the screen cannot be clicked away by cklicking 'hangup'. I think it's for 30 seconds or so, from the time on, when the call was taken. Then suddenly clicking on 'hangup' works. This is very annoying, because as long as I don't click 'hangup', the incoming call screen remains, which forces the phone's display to stay turned on, which uses much battery.</p>

<p>I.e. when a call is completed elsewhere, it is neither logged as a missed call nor is a notification added for it.</p>

<p>The patch touches two areas of CSipSimple:
[I'm posting pastebin URLs for the patch content, since I cannot seem to attach to this issue - "Issue attachment storage quota exceeded".]</p>

<p>A) jni/csipsimple-wrapper is extended to provide get_event_reason_code(pjsip_event*), which allows the java code to extract the SIP cause code from a 'Reason:' header.</p>

<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/zyDazMpD">http://pastebin.com/zyDazMpD</a></p>

<p>B) SipHome is extended as follows:
B.1) SipCallSession / SipCallSessionImpl get a new property lastReasonCode tracking the cause code from the 'Reason:' header
B.2) PjSipCalls maintains this property from its updateSessionFromPj() method
B.3) UAStateReceiver omits all of the missed call logic when there is a 'Reason: ... cause=200 ...' in the CANCEL message.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Please reopen the issue, it is <em>not</em> fixed in current code.</p>

<p>I've tracked down the problems, there appear to be the following issues:</p>

<p>a) get_reason_code() is now run multiple times against the same buffer; this doesn't work since strtok() modifies the string it's supposed to tokenize. I.e. the second invokation of get_reason_code() for the SIP code I'm interested in cannot tokenize the reasen header and therefore does not find the reason code.</p>

<p>A fix is to use strdup()/free() for the header field in get_reason_code(): <a href="https://gist.github.com/jmbreuer/6061204#file-fix-get_reason_header-strtok-patch">https://gist.github.com/jmbreuer/6061204#file-fix-get_reason_header-strtok-patch</a></p>

<p>b) Something about the ordering of messages relative to the UAStateReceiver.on_* callbacks appears to have changed (or I was just lucky the first time around); updateSessionFromPj() is now only called with an event that is a response to the CANCEL message; not the received CANCEL request itself. In the response, it is too late to extract the reason code from the request.</p>

<p>A fix is to also call updateSessionFromPj() from on_call_tsx_state(), and only update the reason code when there actually was one in the message: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jmbreuer/6061204#file-fix-update-rx-reason-patch">https://gist.github.com/jmbreuer/6061204#file-fix-update-rx-reason-patch</a></p>

<p>Ah, and with your slight change in UAStateReceiver.WorkerHandler.handleMessage() the "picked up elsewhere"-calls get logged as "received"; that's very nice.</p></markdown-widget>
