<p>Internet calling</p>

<p>The user can make voice calls over the internet to other users who have SIP accounts. The user can add an internet calling number (a SIP address) to any Contact and can initiate a call from Quick Contact or Dialer. To use internet calling, the user must create an account at the SIP provider of their choice — SIP accounts are not provided as part of the internet calling feature. Additionally, support for the platform's SIP and internet calling features on specific devices is determined by their manufacturers and associated carriers. </p>

<hr>

<p>Besides tried 2.3 on the emulator and no front end...</p>

<p>So there is a need of an app to allow to configure it !!</p>

<p>And besides CSipSimple is already designed to abstract the UI and the sip stack. My API interface between sip stack (for now pjsip) and UI is almost the same than the one proposed by Android. 
So CSipSimple is really the best project to have something working really soon on the top of the android SIP stack.</p>

<p>It will be optional. CSipSimple will allow users to choose between pjsip or the stock android sip stack if available (2.3).
It's amazingly exciting cause it also mean that contact API in android will be enriched with SIP entries.
All my work was not the SIP stack (SIP stack is pjsip) but the user interface to manage SIP accounts and SIP calls !! </p>

<p>And now I'm really happy with the fact I did a true split between the SIP stack and the java application :). It doesn't mean that I'll drop pjsip. Just that I'll allow users to use the CSipSimple with the stock stack (which will be probably much more optimized for android - battery consumption etc etc) but probably not with all features of pjsip.</p>

<p>So my approach was already modular. And now it will take all its sense ! We can even imagine to switch the same account from pjsip to stock sip stack. (depending on codecs we want to use etc etc).</p>

<p>Well a <em>lot</em> of work. But really exciting !! I hope that it will also lead people to help me on the project since it really absolutely make sense now ! And definitely if we succeed to do that, all other SIP agents will sounds really outdated compared to CSipSimple (with the availability to rely on pjsip <em>or</em> on the android stock sip stack).</p>

<p>The only thing that it outdate it is the plugin approach of CSipSimple for Sip providers. (even if some will need more features than the stock sip stack). But plugin approach was almost pjsip_android + an java API on the top of it. Not the UI effort (which actually is CSipSimple).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As soon as I'll have something to test on it will be really quick to have this landed. The android interfaces already really look likes mine.</p>

<p>I've also ported back some piece of code from the new gingerbread to csipsimple.
However there is some part of their code that afraid me a little bit in term of battery usage ! 
Other parts are really interesting (and I've already re-used these parts ;) apache license is compatible with gpl ;) ).
But other parts make me thinking that :
1 - the 2.3 stock stack will be far to be efficient in call (java code + only g711 &amp; gsm codec)
2 - the 2.3 stack may consume more battery that I thought previously (I thought that they did something that did not need of a partial wake lock of the phone while reading the code they seems to simply lock the CPU activity while registered)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Can you confirm that it still works. (There where a quick post deleted by the writer saying it doesn't work anymore on 2.3). So if you can confirm that for you it works could be a good starting point.</p>

<p>Also as I've a doubt on the UDP/TCP port bound locally by native stack, can you test that with one SIP account configured on the stock SIP stack + one other account configured on the CSipSimple stack, you don't get an error at the init of the CSipSimple stack (port already bind error for example).</p>

<p>For the rest, I'll wait for my N1 to be upgraded (according tweets from google guys should land in the next weeks). As I'm used to do unitary tests while developing will be easier for me to have the gingerbread version directly on it :).</p></markdown-widget>
