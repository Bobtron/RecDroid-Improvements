Are you using wifi? If so are you sure there is no firewall on the network that could block media RTP traffic?
If you are using the app under 3G, are you sure that your carrier allow you to use voip apps (some block traffic with firewalls on their network).</p></markdown-widget>

Also tried the advanced setup, but with no difference. I also tried different wifi networks. The other apps I tried were sipdroid and sipgate's own app (which is based on sipdroid). Having the same audio problem with those two. (A HTC Wildfire seemed to work fine in the same network.) If it helps: the only voip app that worked for me audio-wise was 3CXPhone. Still prefer CSipSimple for its usability. Would love to see it fly. :-) </p></markdown-widget>

<p>So I guess they do something special with default configuration different from my default configuration.</p>

<p>What could help me to find clue to solve the problem :
* Send me logs with csipsimple (there is a facility to send logs with latest dev version - in menu &gt; Help (record log, then try to make a call, the end the call and back in help and stop recording, it should ask you for send me logs).
* If it's easy for you ( and if you understand what it means, else forget it ;) ), tcpdump what is happening on the wifi network on router.</p>

<p>Another thing I'm thinking about. If 3CX is installed at the same time as CSipSimple, you absolutely must ensure that both apps are not running at the same time. As both apps are based on the same sip stack, the defaults network ports that they listen to are exactly the same... and so you can get conflicts with the two apps.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Seems that you are in a NATed network at work (that is not resolved by the simple way). STUN may help to resolve this kind of problem and announcing your remote party the correct IP address so that the other party will be able to send you data packets to the correct address. 
If one of your sip provider has a stun server, it's better to use their server. There is a default STUN server pre-filled if you have no idea and just want to test.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>But BTW for me this issue is solved by forcing UDP (see issue 462, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=462">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=462</a>). Audio works both ways, quality is good. Maybe your idea with "Force UDP" as default isn't bad at all :) Unfortunatelly UDP is more battery consuming, isn't it?</p></markdown-widget>

Csipsimple version; CSipSimple_0.00-16-00
Phone; Huawei u8150 Android 2.2 Froyo
Network1: Wireless Broadband HSDPA service using static IP address
Network2: ADSL1 1500 / 256 service using static IP address
All is working quite well with exception of 1 way audio similar to that described here, which as far as I can ascertain for now is only when using Wifi through my home network.
difference: ( wifi only ) Using STUN &amp; ICE I am able to get normal 2 way audio when registrations are fresh. after a certain time period I become unable to receive audio from calls out to mobile phone services only. All other services work without problems of this nature. ( note: this seems only to happen with calls to mobile phones. PSTN &amp; Sip to Sip calls don't have this problem.)</p>

<p>I have a 2nd DID service with the same service provider which I have running through my home network using a Syslink Spa3102 ata. This service runs faultlessly. ( I have also modified the ports on this spa unit away from defaults to cover for any conflicts that may happen between my spa unit &amp; my Huawei phone.
I have also tried port forwarding on my router to the huawei which makes no difference.</p></markdown-widget>
