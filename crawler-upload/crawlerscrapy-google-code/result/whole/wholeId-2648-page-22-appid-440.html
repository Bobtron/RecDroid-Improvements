For testing purpose i would like to make an anonymous call. In the agent which i used for this purpose earlier, there was an option where i could set if my voip caller id is sent or not. If i set this value to no
Privacy: id
header was added to INVITE.
I check there is a possibility to set caller id, but it is adding the name to From header. If it is empty it not adding anything to this header.</p>

<p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
It is not a problem, it is a new request, improvement.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
If caller ID somehow could be set to not send, then Privacy: id header should be put in INVITE.</p>

<p>Sounds you are pretty expert guy in SIP. Try the "Expert" wizard (you can convert an existing sip account to expert wizard by long pressing the row and choose wizard).</p>

<p>You'll then see that you have full control on the configuration and the from header.</p>

<p>Caller-id as presented in advanced wizard is some label for the display name as many sip provider/remote sip clients use this part of the sip uri to extract caller-id.
Each sip provider has his own naming of things (that's one of the reason why there is dedicated wizard per provider). But if you know what is the sip field you want to modify you should find the way to do it in the expert wizard that gives a direct access to the sip stack configuration (which is very configurable : it's pjsip).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>thanks for the fast answer. I have used the expert wizard, but i cannot found at configuration where can i modify there eg. the from header.
Can help me how can i access to access to sip stack?
I have accessed to Caller-id from the dialling pad -  menu - setting - call options, not from the wizard.
In expert wizard i have setting groups as: SIP Account, SIP Authentication, Connection, Proxy, Media transport, Misc, Outbound proxy RFC5626, NAT traversal. And among misc i have options to Voice mail, Subscribe MWI, Auto show video, Auto send video.
So please give me further hint where can i found those settings, that You mentioned.
Thanks a lot!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Here you have to fill something like

<p>If you leave registrar the same, proxy the same and credentials for the account the same; and obviously that your sip server allows that, it should work. 
Maybe you will also need to not use registrar in this case as makes no sense to register as anonymous.</p></markdown-widget>

I would like to restrict my id presentation for certain call, and at old agent i had a parameter, on/off type, for internet caller id presentation. If the parameter turned off it just put privacy header to INVITE with "id" value.</p>

<p>According to RFC3325:
The presence of this privacy type ("Privacy: id") in a Privacy header field indicates that the user would like the Network Asserted Identity to be kept private with respect to SIP entities outside the Trust Domain with which the user authenticated.</p>

<p>So maybe Your solution has similar result, but i would like to use this Privacy header. Also it is easier/ faster to modify for certain calls, where id should be hidden.</p></markdown-widget>

Indeed this RFC is not yet supported by pjsip.
I already added some plugin for the P-Preferred-Identity (that was never finished).
So I transform this issue to track progress on RFC3325 support that will be basically adding "P-Preferred-Identity" and "Privacy:" header support (which may also cover parts of RFC3323)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For us we would prefer it be put in the P-Preferred-Identity header as thats most accurate place for it. However I know Asterisk for example doesnt support P-Preferred-Identity and if you tel it to trust the pai headers it will pull the callerid from the P-Asserted-Identity header.</p>

<p>Just a bit of background of how these headers work in the telecomms world in the UK (NICC standard ND1017) you can read on or just ignore if you are not interested :)</p>

<p>In the UK systems have two different telephone numbers. There is the Billing number which can also be known as the line number or ANI number. If you have an ISDN30 line for example and multiple ddi numbers then the ISDN30 line has the first number and you can present that number or any other DDI number that you own.
When a call is sent to another telco all this information is in the SS7 UK-ISUP packets. The ND1017 states what should happen when the ISUP call gets translated to SIP. The callerid that is to be presented is put in the P-Preferred-Identity header  and also the From header with the Privacy header containing the presentation value. The Billing number is placed in the P-Asserted-Identity unless this is marked as to be withheld (via a parameter called the CBI) in which case that header is omitted.
Its all a bit of a bodge and means systems designed to work in the UK often need different rules when talking to other systems. Also the vast majority of telcos in the UK dont support the standard anyway! Just included incase anyone is interested.</p></markdown-widget>
