<p>Report from customer regarding one way voice with Grandstream devices.</p>

<p>If Csipsample use 1 codec it's working ok.
When they setup more then 1 codec in Csipsample, it use <br>
Update mathod in final phase of negotiation with Grandstream devices.
I do not see something strange in TcpDump.</p>

<p>As the result of my quick investigation the followed devices 
do not support Update method at all:
Asterisk,
Cisco routers,
Linksys from tiny to big
Snom..</p>

<p>As the result I suspect you do not test Update with other devices.
Or it just a Grandstream trouble.</p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>I can setup Grandstream device, include full access to settings on my network for developers testing. Let's me know if you need it.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Indeed, that's a known problem in pjsip sip stack.</p>

<p>Actually here what's happen :</p>

<ul>
<li>pjsip does not support multiple codec at a time for a media session once <em>established</em>.</li>
<li>As consequence, in order to fix that pjsip guys decided to do an re-invite or update (according to what is announced in capabilities) (which is absolutely compliant with SIP RFC !!!) in order to select only one codec when the remote party decide to establish communication with multiple codecs.</li>
<li>This only occurs on outgoing calls (cause obviously it's in this situation that it's up to the remote party to decide which codec to choose). For incoming call, since pjsip decide which codec to use, no problem at all!</li>
</ul>

<p>About remote party that are not compliant with this part of the RFC, you probably use an old Asterisk version cause AFAIK, this is fixed in their latest version (obvisouly, if it's the asterisk server that decide of the content of the sdp and of the media negociation... if it's transparent for media negociation, the problem is on the UA ).</p>

<p>You should have a look to this comment : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=810#c13">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=810#c13</a>.
and this one : <a href="http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/476">http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/ticket/476</a> (for pjsip project).</p>

<p>So.... to fix that... unfortunately it would mean to change pjsip, and that's not relevant of csipsimple project. I try to keep the stack as provided by the pjsip project in order to make things easier to maintain. I can however raise the issue to pjsip guys and see what they think about that.</p>

<p>Besides, keep in mind that what pjsip does is compliant with RFC ! So the "bug" is not on pjsip side, but on the side that does not support the re-invite / update. 
Or with the configuration of the server in the middle that tell UPDATE is supported while it is not supported on the UA endpoint, and that the server is not the media gateway (I mean it announce something for the other endpoint while the other endpoint does not support that...).</p>

<p>So first I'd advise to check the configuration and see if there is not something wrong on the configuration. (For example if you can take some Tcpdump for your sip server &lt;-&gt; csipsimple + sip server &lt;-&gt; grandstream. 
And have a close look to capabilities (UPDATE capability), and what is sent from each endpoint about this re-invite.</p>

<p>Besides, last point, if you have this issue, it's not specific to csipsimple, pjsip is a widely used sip stack, and if you get the problem with csipsimple, you'll get that with many other sip clients (there is a lot of sip client for iphone based on pjsip, and even on android, 3CX softphone is also based on pjsip -- even if this one is not opensource).</p>

<p>Keep me in touch with that, I'll be pleased to help to debug if needed. (Maybe the problem is in pjsip however, and if so, with full tcpdump I could raise the issue to pjsip guys).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Well according to the reply on pjsip mailing list sounds some hack can be done to workaround a bad behavior of grandstream device (I guess it announce to support UPDATE while it only support re-INVITE).</p>

<p>In order to not break the correct behavior of pjsip that is compliant with RFC and keep that as a workaround, what I can propose is to try to dive into pjsua and add an extra option to it in order to add a "workaround for Grandstream bug" that should probably be de-activated by default (could be discussed... I don't know yet impact of always using re-invite instead of update).</p>

<p>I'd be interested by your tcpdump anyway, it's just to confirm my guess about the fact the bug is well on grandstream side and not something in pjsip that think the other side announce to support update while it doesn't ;).</p>

<p>You can follow the HowToCollectLogs wiki page to get logs from CSipSimple side and/or send me tcpdump to : developers at csipsimple dot com</p>

<p>Thanks !</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I was the one who replied to the mailing list. Actually is not a hack, sending a re-INVITE is perfectly fine as per the RFC. Also, support for it is more wide spread that support for UPDATE with SDP. Some servers will not even fix the Contact header for UPDATEs because they assume they will never have an SDP...</p>

<p>I'd change it to re-INVITE always, for the sake of interoperability. The attached patch implements that.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot for the patch.</p>

<p>Actually the problem, which does not respect RFC, is the fact that the device announce to support UPDATE in the supported field, while it actually does not !</p>

<p>If the remote party does not announce to support UPDATE, pjsip will send a re-INVITE. And this behavior is absolutely correct.</p>

<p>I mean, if the remote side that does not support UDPATE, and does not announce that it support UPDATE, everything will go fine !</p>

<p>If remote side support update, it would be better to keep a way to actually use UPDATE cause it use less bandwidth.
That's why I'd prefer to add an option instead of something hardcoded. </p>

<p>But, your patch will help me a lot cause it point out where to add the option :) Thanks a lot. I'll do that right now.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>That was a quick response :-)</p>

<p>IMHO, since both UPDATE and re-INVITE are correct (assuming the phone acts accordingly), I'd go for no option and use the most interoperable approach. If anyone would ever (I don't expect this to happen) ask for an option to use UPDATE instead of a re-INVITE an option can be made, but its probably not worth the effort right now.</p>

<p>My 2 cents :-)</p></markdown-widget>
