<p>First of all (but not important) the "dialing vibrate feedback" does not work if "dialing tone feedback" is not selected.</p>

<p>More important though is an old issue revisited. Every time I make a call the cell defaults to speaker phone and then the phone locks up when I press the speaker button and csipsimple freezes and needs to be force closed.</p>

<p>Would be nice if csipsimple works on this phone as it's the first decent Android phone under $300 (I am also looking into upgrading to Android 2.1)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The problem about dialing vibrate feedback is fixed in latest dev version. It should also be more stable.</p>

If none of audio troubleshooting hacks do the trick, could you send me logs (see the wiki page about collecting logs).</p></markdown-widget>

Unfortunately for you CSipSimple is now translated to chinese ;)... so will be hard inside the app too ;)</p>

<p>So the fact that you do not observe freeze anymore is a really good point. I guess that was cause motorola had bad audio driver implementation in the past and fixed things.
As for the fact it sometimes switches to the speaker I think that there is already an open issue like that. I'll try to find it and check if it's with the same device.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>No unfortunately this kind of issue is very hard to debug and to say just for logs.</p>

<p>In this kind of problems, that's due to some ~bad~ (not standard regarding the android platform) implementation from the manufacturer. In this case, usually the first thing I do is testing all existing acks. In your case Motorola consider clearly something wrong, say that audio mode "Normal" should always route to speaker. Which is a very bad idea for voip apps.</p>

<p>Did you try "Use MODE API" setting? I guess that you'll observe a different behavior. When manufacturer consider that mode "Normal" should route to speaker, they also consider that mode "In_call" should route to earpiece. In this case the Option in csipsimple "Use Mode API" use mode normal and in_call to route or not to the speaker.
However it could become worse. Some manufacturer consider that in "Mode IN_CALL" applications should not receive sound from micro... In this case they directly plug micro to GSM chipset... which is fine for telephony app... but make things impossible for VoIP app.</p>

<p>So if you could give me feedback trying to play with mode API and other audio hacks (see the audio troubleshooting section in the FAQ), it could help to understand what is the approach of motorola for this issue.</p>

<p>If "mode API" does not help, test with other SIP clients (specially opensource ones). If you get one working with it let me know I could have a look. But if none works with it... you should fear that none of the SIP application will succeed in supporting this device... and cry to motorola...</p>

<p>(Crackling sound could be due to garbage collector - which I'll eliminate in Gingerbread release ;) ... but not sure xt502 will be updated :( )</p></markdown-widget>

<p>2 -&gt; I guess they use the same thing than me ;)... Unfortunately that's due to mistakes (or misunderstood) from manufacturers... coders are really disappointed about that. Fortunately 2.3 will lead to more unity cause manufacturer will be obliged to do something good, else 2.3 stock sip app will not work.</p>

<p>3 -&gt; Garbage collector is some java feature. As memory is released dynamically in java, frequently, a Garbage collection is launched. During this process it blocks the entire processing of other stuff and collect unused allocated memory. It's linked to the fact memory is managed by the JVM. Music player and voice calls is managed entirely on the native stack.
My new driver using OpenSL is not affected by that cause it is entirely done in the native stack. My old driver I had, based on a private API of android (which is quietly exactly the same than the one used by the stock android 2.3 app) was also not affected. But unfortunately as it was based on private API it was not portable at all.
As consequence :
4 -&gt; you need to run a 2.3 device (so updating your device) and the ginger build of csipsimple available on nightly build website in the folder "ginger".</p>

<p>5 -&gt; Be careful about "hacks" some introduce less stability. For example some could increase Garbage collector time and as consequence affect performances of VoIP apps, but helps for other performance stuff (benchmarking, battery maybe...)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>4 -&gt; ginger build is almost the same thing excepted one file which is the audio dev. Obviously it's more recent than the other dev. However, the OpenSL ES api is much much much better than the awful Java API of android. Job done by Khronos with this api make it more easier for developpers to implement things. As consequence comparing the two implementation, I'm more confident in the newer.</p>

<p>As for future... well I don't know yet. As for this specific point, would not be too hard for me to have an universal build. I have a lot of possible solutions in my mind to allow plugins that would allow such native extensions. Not yet decided which I'll use. I resent to re-use the old way with managing downloads by my own cause it leads to too much instablitly and bad user experience. Could be done by distributing plugins APK... or use the future in app "purchase" feature of the market (even if free plugins of course ;) ).
I also resent forking into multiple builds. It make things confusing for users and for support, and besides to fit more users needs, it's better to split into plugins than distributing only 2 versions.</p></markdown-widget>
