1. call anywhere</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expected to hear sound through the handset, however,nothing is heard UNLESS I activate the rear speaker! Then I can hear the other party! However, it is not possible to switch to handset, only read speaker can be used for audio output. </p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Android 2.1
Version 15</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
I know this seems to be a problem for most SAMSUNG Androids, however, maybe a workaround is possible.

So I'll need more infos :

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>I've done an update that could help to debug the problem :</p>

<p>Could you try to install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-15-16.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-15-16.apk</a> .</p>

<p>It include 3 hidden settings. To activate it :
Go in Settings &gt; press menu and switch to "Expert mode".
Then in Settings &gt; Media scroll to the bottom.
The 3 settings are :
Use Routing API =&gt; It enforce to use the old API that is deprecated in android 2.0. Some ROM however are based on old audio drivers but are &gt; to 2.0. In this case activating this setting can help
Use Mode API =&gt; It enforce to use something that is actually not an API but that is considered by some manufacturer to be the way to route audio... It's a very bad idea to use that on some device cause it use mode_in_call that directly plug GSM chipset to audio hardware. But sometimes on some devices that's the only way to get routing goes through earpiece.
In Call Mode =&gt; (Useless if you use "Mode API"), Force to use one audio mode. On most device should be set to Normal. But sometimes could be interesting to test others.</p>

<p>Let me know if one of these option helps, if so I can maybe make something that automatically configure for i5800</p>

<p>Thanks</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Well.... Samsung samsung samsung... why?!??? I don't know who codes audio drivers for android at samsung but I think that's a trainee.... </p>

<p>That's really amazing what I discovered is that with standard options, you can get it working through earpiece.
(Routing API OFF, Mode Audio OFF and Audio Mode NORMAL)</p>

<p>It will work for incoming calls each time... and for outgoing calls, you have to produce a sound with the phone just 3s&lt; before to start the call (for example pressing volume button or using dialpad audio feedback).... 
If you do so, the audio driver goes in a good audio mode and let streamed audio be rendered by the audio driver. Funny isn't it :)
And even better worse than in my nightmares, to make the speaker work I've to use IN_CALL mode ... IN CALL goes through speaker by default while NORMAL goes through earpiece....</p>

<p>So I think that I can have a tweaked version for this phone.... but it is just unbelievable the way they do their driver...
Had a quick look this morning to forum threads on XDA and have seen a lot of ROM makers crying about bugs on the audio driver of samsung device...</p>

<p>Well fortunately they've opensourced their driver so openfully custom ROM makers will contribute to these crappy audio drivers.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For the echo-ing : if echo is present on the CSipSimple part, it mean that it is the other part that produce the echo. 
If the echo is present on the other side it means that CSipSimple produce the echo. If so, you should simply try to reduce sound level (by default on Teos is really loud. There is a settings (in ExpertSettingMode that may allow you to reduce that by default for each calls).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I think that your current configuration is to use "Mode API". With some device and some samsung driver version it's cause GSM chipset is directly connected to micro (and in this case apps can't record anything in this case).</p>

<p>I'd advise you to try to play with audio hacks : Use routing api (on/off), use mode api (on/off), use tone hack (on/off).</p>

<p>If you find some good combination I'll be pleased to set this as default hack for the device. 
But definitely that's cause of Samsung driver ! What I propose here is just workarounds cause of the VERY BAD audio drivers from Samsung.
I also have to add that I have a i5800 to test on and now with Tone hack set to ON it works better (routing and mode api to off).
They recently (probably thanks to the fact they worked with google on the nexus S), fixed a little bit their driver on some models.
So I'd also advise if available on your phone to upgrade the phone to the latest version too.</p></markdown-widget>

Basically, none is needed anymore with the latest version of Android 2.2. You are right about the Mic and GSM set. Without a GSM Card, no App can hear the Mic. If I put the GSM Card in, Apps can hear the mic again - why not Csip? </p></markdown-widget>

<p>As for the fact you do not observe in other apps could be explain I think : CSipSimple use a different method to record audio that allow almost "real time" recording while other apps use an higher API where samsung do probably their strange (and private) things before calling the lower interface I use. As consequence you can observe diffs between apps cause of that.</p></markdown-widget>
