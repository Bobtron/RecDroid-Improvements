it should register, sipdroid tcp only do register.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
i use pbxes and from my test and what is in this thread, pbxes need UDP to register, but since this thread dated from july 2010 , i was asking if we still need to add the transporttcp line and you also mention UDP was sending packet every 20 sec cmpare to tcp 90 sec  , so if we can change the setting for udp will it help the battery to not drain so fast?  if i activate tcp and udp will csipsimple use the udp to register only and when receiving or making call will it use tcp ?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok several points :)</p>

<p>Well first thing is that I think that you are trying to configure the wrong way with TCP.
The user interface is not so easy to understand but what should be understood from global settings (the one you get from dialer menu &gt; settings &gt; network) is that it's actually global settings.
Here you tell if you want csipsimple to activate or not a transportation mode. It does not mean that an account will or not use this mode. The transport mode is a per account setting.
And as such, it has to be configured in account settings.
If you try to use the advanced wizard mode or the expert wizard mode, you'll see that there is a checkbox or list option to choose the transport you want to configure for this account.
There is not (anymore) such an option in pbxes.org wizard. The reason is <em>very</em> good, pbxes.org is BUGGY on TCP transport. They have a bug they don't fix because they encourage users to use their own sip client (sipdroid). But the behavior they have is not sip valid at all. (about that you can refer this issue : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=604&amp;q=pbxes.org">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=604&amp;q=pbxes.org</a> ) There is still a possible workaround that I could implement to break the correct SIP behavior of the sip stack I use to be able to be compatible with the wrong SIP behavior of pbxes.org.
You can also try to force using tcp  : by transforming your pbxes.org account in an advanced wizard account : long press the account &gt; choose wizard &gt; advanced). And then edit and check 'use tcp' box.
It will register properly. But the hangup of an establish call will timeout. (In fact pbxes.org replies the app to use UDP for subsequent dialogs while they do not support that at all and consider that's a new dialog that has nothing to do with previous).
That's why I don't show (anymore) the option in pbxes.org wizard.</p>

<p>About keep alive now. In fact it's not anymore 20 seconds. It's something you can configure in networks settings (if you switched to ExpertSettingMode before). It's keep alive over wifi and keep alive over mobile that you can entierely configure.
In nightly builds (<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a>) there the same option for TCP and TLS transports.
By default for udp it's 80 sec on mobile and 120 on wifi. On wifi it often can be augmented a lot I took the minimal timeout from user feedback, but not all networks needs such a low keep alive value. It really depends on your network, so it's about testing on your side ;).</p>

<p>About TCP problem, you should do lobbying on pbxes.org so that they fix that. It's not only annoying for csipsimple but for all sip clients that respect sip RFC on this point (at least all clients based on pjsip sip stack).
It could indeed be workaround in client side, but it would mean to do extra crappy development on our side which is not really fair because the bug is not here ;)</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>No problem that's voluntarily a little bit hidden because I don't want to mess mainstream users with these consideration. Most of them don't understand what TCP and UDP means.
Normally if a sip provider contact me with valid and well working preconfigured settings, I'll put that in a wizard so that mainstream user will not have to bother with that and just have the best config ;). The dark side is that for expert users it's more hidden and maybe confusing :)</p>

<p>About transforming your account to a tcp account.
Go in the view where there is all your accounts (probably only one for now ;) ). You can see one pbxes.org line. Long press the right part of the pbxes.org line. Then you'll see a dialog that allow to do several actions on the account (activate, delete,...) and change wizard. Choose change wizard, here you'll find the wizard selection list. In the "generic" section you can see an advanced wizard. Select it. Then your account will become an advanced account (the icon will change). If you edit the account, you'll see some new options. The tcp checkbox is here, click it and save .</p>

<p>About keep alive. Well in fact the battery life time does not depends on the fact it's TCP or UDP. It depends on keep alive interval only.
The reason why you see everybody telling that TCP is better for battery life is that it requires a lower frequency (higher interval) to be kept alive. This is just empiric result from common network router.
A network router between the sip client and the sip server can decide that the sip socket is dead depending on various criterias. If nothing comes on the socket after a long time it may decide to cut it. The "long time" usually depends on the kind of a socket. A TCP socket has a higher time configured on routers (due to the way it's managed). </p>

<p>But that finally depends on routers configuration. That's why it's very hard to tell a good value for keep alive interval.</p>

<p>So this keep alive is needed to try to keep the connection alive and the socket established between the server and the client. Sometimes, the server already has a keep alive mechanism which make the keep alive on client side useless.
Now how it works... well it's very simple each xx secondes (xx is the keep alive interval), the client ask android to wake cpu (it does not mean to wake screen ;) ), and send on the socket a 2 byte packet. </p>

<p>As consequence you rapidely understand that this has a big impact on battery. As frequent you'll ask the app to keep alive, as frequent the phone's cpu will be wake up which obviously consume battery. Since waking up cpu has overhead on battery consumption it's even non linear. So the more espaced keep alive interval is, the less it will consume battery.</p>

<p>So, finally TCP helps to configure a higher keep alive interval, because TCP is less subject by nature to be cut by routers (even some routers does not cut it for very very long time).
But, if you configure the app to have exactly the same keep alive interval for TCP and UDP, you'll get the same battery footprint ;)</p>

<p>Also something good to know, STUN feature also impacts battery usage. Nightly build have a different approach on STUN management that may also helps reducing battery usage.</p></markdown-widget>

That's the bug of pbxes.org, they ask client to change the transport (switch to udp) in the middle, but their server does not reply on udp and considers that's a new dialog.</p>

<p>So normally you should leave both transports activated :). Besides it does not imply more battery consumption and it has no negative effect so no reason to deactivate one transport.</p>

<p>About media quality it has no impact because media is transported over RTP in SIP (so it's always UDP ;) ). Here TCP/UDP choice is about control plane not the media plane.</p></markdown-widget>
