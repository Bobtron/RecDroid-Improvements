<p>What is the version of the application (one from android market? 0.04-04?) or a nightly build version?</p>

<p>Also, when you say that "internet connection" is working properly. By "internet connection" do you mean web browsing with http protocol?
SIP protocol is a different one that operates on different ports. 
Some mobile carrier/ wifi hotspot block these port to prevent you from doing voice over IP on their network.
Solution is to ask them to unlock it if you can or to encrypt sip connection / change port if the sip provider support it.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>BTW, are you connecting using UDP or TCP? Some networks has UDP packet size limitation. Would be very low if blocking at register for your network but could be interesting to check if activating "Compact SIP" in network settings doesn't help.</p>

<p>Else, another difference that can appear from one device to another is the "User-agent". By default it's CSipSimple + some information about device codename (as nknown by the device itself) and the android version.
Maybe the sip server on the other side get hard time to decode this user agent (for example if contains space or other chars not well supported by server).
To try to change the User agent setting :
go in settings, press menu , Expert mode (if was not already done).
Then in network section there is the option to change useragent. Try something different from CSipSimple (it will not add device codename and android version in this case).</p></markdown-widget>

I have tried both points mentioned by you regarding the registration issue.
User Agent and expert mode are not working as a solution for registration issue.</p>

<p>Additionally, I found some stuff which may be useful in providing the solution of this problem.</p>

<p>The registration problem arises whenever there is a network change in the device.
Such that if device is connected with 3g and wifi is switched on or off then either registration fails or call does not get connected.
This issue also arises when bluetooth or any other network media is turned on or off.</p>

<p>Whatever I got from reviewing the code from googlecode is that the pjsip stack ,that CSipSimple app is using, stops whenever there is some network change due to which problem arises.
This may be due to the possible bug in checks applied on the code in order to check the network connection of the device.
Is there any solution by which we can check the accessibility of the client application to the sip server so that inspite of network change the app detect the direct accessibility to the server ...watsay</p>

<p>I am a newbie for android and java so requires ur kind support for solving this issue.
Thanks and Regards,
Anurag</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ah !
It's very important information. I thought you had <em>always</em> no registration and were never able to register using csipsimple.</p>

<p>So I think I get the root reason with this information.</p>

<p>Your sip server probably support limited number of simultaneous registration.</p>

<p>When the network is lost, the app is not able to clear the pending registration on the server. So it increase number of registrations for your user on the server.</p>

<p>Then networks come back. The app tries to register. 
If server has limited number of possible registration and has no policy to drop older registration in this case, it will refuse the new registration.</p>

<p>It will work again when one of the slot of your previous registrations will timeout.</p>

<p>A clean solution would be to store in the app old registration and reinject it to the stack. Not easy. 
But, there is an existing workaround that tries to clear all registration when get an error on a registration and then try to re-register.
To activate this option, long press the account row, choose wizard and choose expert one.
And enable the option "Try to clean registrations" (not sure it works on a timeout error however... but if so you should raise the problem to your sip provider, they should refuse the registration with an actual error rather than just not replying to the request).</p>

<p>Another tweak you could do is to reduce the registration timeout/interval value so that registrations will expire quickly.</p></markdown-widget>

unfortunately the status is "Error while registering-Request timeout"</p>

<p>I want to mention that on moto defy It was never registered.
On another device It got registered but on network change account becomes inactive and calls failed to connect.</p>

<p>My point is same as like urs either we can prevent the app to detect minor flaws in the network, only major network failure(when there is not a single network connection available such as 3g, wifi etc).
If device switches from from one to another then old registration can be re injected to the stack... </p></markdown-widget>
