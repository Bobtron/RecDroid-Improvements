                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>There are two groups of problems:
1. Time-to-time CSS looses registration, then it starts registering again by itself
2. CSS may fall into a state, where it doesn't send REGISTER requests anymore. Manual push is required</p>

<p>First group of cases - the reason perhaps is irregularity in sending REGISTER requests. If "expired" time set to, let say, 10 min, it may send next request in 12 min or more (sometimes the delay could be an hour or even more). During the time, when it's late, CSS is obviously unregistered from VoIP provider and can't get incoming calls. At the same time it could send REGISTER requests earlier, then configured. E.g. it may send next request in 1 or 2 min after the last one, making unnecessary registrations... See example posted in &lt;a href="<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=81#c86&quot;&gt;Comment">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=81#c86"&gt;Comment</a> #86&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

<p>Second group of cases - I've noticed that CSS may suddenly just stop sending REGISTER requests at all. At that time other accounts (I keep several accounts active at a time) continue to make registrations as usual...</p>

<p>The message, when it's stuck, could be:
Error while registering -
Unauthorized</p>

<p>If I catch that (for example, in a morning I may discover that it's stuck for the whole night) I may deactivate the account and then activate it again. It registers immediately (there is no "Unauthorized" problem, of cause). That's very dangerous scenario - I think it's registered with VoIP provider, while it's not and I can't get any calls, of cause :(</p>

<p>The worst scenario though is when CSS gets stuck showing, that it's registered, while it's not. See my &lt;a href="<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=1066#c5&quot;&gt;comment">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=1066#c5"&gt;comment</a> #5&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately it happens in very rare occasions.</p>

<p>Note: in all cases cell phone is completely idle (no any user interaction with the phone). Watching registration status was done by checking VoIP provider's status page and SIP server log.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but it's very frustrating to see how unreliable is SIP registration process in CSS :(</p>

<p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Watch for registration status with VoIP provider
2. Push CSS to make registration, if it's stuck with "Unauthorized" error <br>
3. Check, if CSS is really registered, or it's only shows, that it is, while it's not (check VoIP provider's status to see that)</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
CSS is registered with VoIP provider(s) all the time</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Latest market build, 0.02-03 r944
Android 2.1 </p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>OK, here is the latest experience. Look at today's log made by FreeSWITCH (I had two active accounts configured in CSS: one with FS and another one with VoIP provider). It contains timestamps of REGISTER requests, coming from CSS. Keep in mind that registration period is set to 10 min.
<a href="http://pastebin.com/MnG92fHC">http://pastebin.com/MnG92fHC</a></p>

<p>As you can see, the night begun quite well. CSS registered every 10 min. But then, after 00:31:00, things started to get bizarre... There are multiple registrations at the same time, registrations in one minute period, late registrations and registration complete out of any array... Finally, it stopped working at all (the log provided was taken at 11:00, not at 09:14:33, the last event registered).</p>

<p>Now, when I checked CSS (accessing from status bar) - it indicated, that both accounts were active (providers indicated - they were not, of cause). I tired to make them inactive manually. Weird thing is, the green bar below wizard icon got black, while the account name still green with the note - "Registered". Toggling them multiple times did not help. Closing CSS via its menu "Disconnect" did not work... It still running. Only killing by Task Manager finally helped.</p>

<p>During the night I did not touch the phone. It was idle with screen off. CSS suddenly stopped working during that time (no any activity from my side initiated that). </p>

<p>Something is seriously wrong with registration scheduler.</p></markdown-widget>

If it will - when? It's been almost two weeks, since this ticket was opened, and it seems like this very important issue is simply abandoned... </p>

<p>BTW, this night around 4:00AM, CSipSimple has suddenly stopped registering. When I discovered that, there was no CSipSimple icon on Status bar. But Android Task Manager displayed, that CSipSimple still running. Killing it with Task Manager eventually helped to restart its registering with SIP server... </p></markdown-widget>

1st : the issue is not abandonned at all
2nd : I develop CSipSimple on my free time... this is absolutely not professional support, if you want apps with a pro support there is tones of paid sip apps on android market ;)
3rd : it take me time to get this fixed cause I do not reproduce that on sip providers I use (and besides I have no asterisk setup to debug this issue in details)</p>

<p>So =&gt; be indulgent AND feel fee to contribute the app !!!</p>

<p>To all : There were already opened issue abut that 859, 912, 999, 1072, 1163. I merged all in this one cause it's well described and logs are very useful. Besides maintaining many issues eat me all my free time... So even if all were not exactly the same, I suspect the root cause is identical , so just track this issue and add your new comments here.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The best way to troubleshoot is to watch events, when CSS sends its REGISTER requests to a SIP server. The SIP server could be any one, that is available from free offers. I do not have Asterisk, but I've installed free version of FreeSWITCH for WIndows. There is MSI installation package on their site, available to download.
"<a href="http://files.freeswitch.org/windows/installer/x86/">http://files.freeswitch.org/windows/installer/x86/</a>"</p>

<p>After you run installer you may star using it immediately. Default configuration includes 20 extension numbers, ready for registering. Just configure one of those extensions in CSS, start FS and watch its log (or look at its running console). You can easily see when exactly CSS sends those REGISTER requests and when it stops doing that...  Let me know if you need any help with starting using FS.</p>

<p>You've mentioned that you don't reproduce that problem with your SIP provider. Yes, indeed, SIP provider doesn't give you a detailed log (at leas mine does not offer that). The only way to find the problem is to check current registration with them (if they give you a web console that shows current status) and that what I'm doing too. Time-to-time I see account in red - meaning unregistered... It's not a convenient way to watch. And that's why I'd recommend to install FreeSWITCH (or any other SIP server) locally and use it as a test tool.</p>

<p>I understand that it's not product for a pay. But I repeat again, if it fails to register (on a timely manner or stops doing that at all) - there is no big reason to use the phone... It's very serious issue.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I'm still investigating however. I probably didn't spent enough time yet and it was on a very reliable wifi local connection. So I'll try different configuration.</p>

<p>I have a global idea of what could improve things. It would be to change the way the timer glue is done in pjsip. Currently it use a basic implementation (the one of linux), but this one is not really good for android cause on android cpu can go off.</p>

<p>The thing I did to workaround that was to rely on the fact keep alive is managed by csipsimple itself (that do things in java space and can use the android SDK to awake the phone when needed). But re-registration does not use this mechanism. So maybe on some device that have an aggressive policy regarding cpu sleeping re-registration can not be launched or delayed for long time.
The problem is that to solve this problem it means modifying significantly the way pjsip is integrated to android. Even better would be to take the approach that pjsip guys adopted for symbian which does not use worker threads -- it would also increase battery life. 
But this should be done with care. I started to get a global overview of what was done in pjsip for symbian and I'll try to do something similar for android. </p>

<p>In the same time, I'll try to find out a solid repro scenario on my side so that I'll be more confidant with the fact something fix or not the issue ;).</p>

<p>I think that the device I'm currently testing on does not have a suffisant aggressive policy regarding sleeping of the CPU. I have other devices I can test on (not here cause I'm in holiday), so hopefully one of these will have this behavior (or maybe tweaking the cyanogenMod on this device)</p>

<p>I'll keep you in touch if I find something interesting or if there is something new to test. Sorry for the time it took to solve this issue. I understand that it's very annoying for a daily usage for those who need to be reachable.</p></markdown-widget>

First of all, thank you for the detailed overview of the current status. I'm glad that you want to solve the problem and have some ideas on how to do that.</p>

<p>Do you have access to source code of SipDroid? I guess, it could help you to find out yet another way to use timer. From my past experience (I don't use it now, CSS is my primary client for this time), SipDroid was very regular with its registration.</p>

<p>I'm using a good WiFi connection too (most of the time). But I usually change my WiFi presence couple of times per day. And at that time, when I drive away from my WiFi spot, the connection easily become unstable and finally drops. I guess that could somehow contribute to instability of CSS (it's just a wild guess, of cause). I don't see strong correlation with that so far...</p>

<p>Another point here (why I see the instability and you don't) could be that I'm still using unmodified Android v.2.1 installed by manufacturer. I guess I have to update the OS, but before doing so I want to root the phone in order to make its full backup... I guess that could help (or may be it's just a wish thinking)...  </p>

<p>In any case, thank again and please keep us in touch.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>r1005 that will be produced tonight will probably implements the new way to manage pjsip timers (using android SDK and being more agressive regarding cpu power).</p>

<p>It's maybe not very stable yet. Feedback welcome.</p>

<p>It also introduce an option in expert wizard mode to "Try to clean registers".</p>

<p>Many sip providers allows to have several registrations on their server with a limit.
For example it allows 3 registrations for an account.
In this case, csipsimple that run a mobile device, may consume more registrations that actually needed. For example, if the app is connected through wifi and lost connection it is not possible for the application to unregister. As consequence it will leave a dead registration on the server. And when wifi (or another connection) will come up again, it will create a new registration.
Unfortunately, the server on the other side can reach the limit of allowed registrations and just say forbidden (or other error code) for the new register.
The "Try to clean registers" is a workaround to address this problem. When it see an error when trying to register, it tries to unregister all registrations on the server (csipsimple's ones but also possibly registrations from other clients), and then try a fresh register.</p>

<p>Other point, as the new timers method is more agressive, if stun is activated you may observe bigger battery usage (even if I tried to limit this bad effect).</p></markdown-widget>

And the weirdest thing: only when I'm under Wi-Fi! Under mobile data, everything seems to work. This is incredible! How come Gingerbread closes communication applications? They are too important to be killed! Regis, is there anything you can do about it? I already checked the 'partial wake lock', as well as the 'High perfs' settings, to no avail.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hello,
These days csipsimple started registration issues again. I will send a log now. It looses registration and does not try to re-register again though I have set the option "try to clean registers" Sometimes it freezes at "green". I mean it shows registered but it is actually not and it does not try to re-register if I "push" the button on and off again. Sometimes it freezes at "orange" -&gt; Not Registered. The only way to fix this is to restart the application by killing it. Disconnect does not work. It will be nice if you can put an option "try to register forever" or something similar.
I also saw another unusual activity I do not know if it is related to this and I apologize if I wrote it in a wrong thread. When I hang up it does not remove the "vibration only" symbol and when I try the volume up button it shows me that I'm changing the call volume as I'm still in a call. That started a few revision ago. It happens only sometimes. Again the only solution is to kill the application and start it again.</p>

<p>Best Regards,
Asen</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Same problem as you Asen, I opened an issue yesterday regarding that
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=1295">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=1295</a> (merge them maybe?)
I haven't found anyone else experiencing that issue, and it's hard to reproduce it. Asen, are you using some plugin like Betamax plugin? I don't know if it can be related.</p>

<p>For your second issue (vibration only), I didn't notice that as I'm almost always in vibration mode, but I'll make tests and keep you updated so that we will see if there is a link between these issues.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Until I realise that Wifi is switch off when the screen goes black (sleep mode ...). I don't know if this is the same issue for you .... To force android to keep the wifi ON in sleep mode: under android parameter, in wifi press menu button, in advanced menu pops up, set your wifi sleep policy to NEVER.</p>

<p>With this setting, i don't lose registation with voip.ms (not extensive test done yet ...).</p>

<p>In WIFI, It seems to work: registration is OK (with the sleep policy to NEVER cut wifi in the android parameter), heart beat (40s) , time to register (600s) ...</p>

<p>BUT in 3G, with exactly same paremeters (heartbeat, time to registerer ...), I always lost the registration after several minutes.</p>

<p>Do you know if it's possible that the phone fall to a Deep Sleep Mode and then cut the 3G connexion ? Is there a </p>

<p>I don't think it's a "pure" CSS issue, but a combinaison of factor between CSS and Android OS.</p>

<p>How could I debug this issue: the log (in help menu) only give me the registration:
Based on the GPL CSipSimple version : 0.02-03 r944

I did a lot of changes to lock cpu only when a timer has to be fired. So it should reduce cpu impact and increase reliablity of the connection. Still the app is not stable enough to be released I think, and there is also other use case where re-registration get problems (mainly due to stun/ice I think).
But it could be a good base to test on since r944 is pretty outdated compared to nightly build on this issue.</p></markdown-widget>

If i can keep the registration ON in 3G, you could count on a donation (this will save me so much money to use CSipSimple+voip.ms+3G instead of my Telco Voice plan !)</p>

<p>FYI, I have the same pb in 3G with:
 - r944
 - "lock CPU/Utiliser le verrouillage du CPU" activate
 - STUN activate (stun.counterpath.com)
 - ICE: not activated !
 - Allow UDP and TCP (just in case ;-)
 - heartbeat 40s in mobile mode</p>

<p>See log file below</p>

<p>I begin an other test (with 944) by activating ICE (not sur what it is but if it's better for Nat traversal it could help) ... and let you know the results

<p>This happens when connected via WiFi. One of my SIP servers is actually my WiFi router (a Fritz!Box 7170 by AVM) which is in the same WiFi network as the phone so WAN disruptions can be ruled out in this case.</p>

<p>But after a while the icons and entries (for all SIP registrations) in the status pull-down menu simply vanish, as if CSS just terminates for some reason, and the phone doesn't react to incoming SIP calls any more.</p>

<p>When I start CSS manually it registers again and works as expected. When I leave CSS and stop using the phone the registration is gone again after a while, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>His problem was fixed by using startForeground() but as I'm not a developer I can't give you more information about in which context to use it. I hope it will help anyway.</p>

<p>My conf: Samsung Galaxy S2 with android 2.3.5 and r1051.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></markdown-widget>

I had to go back to r1050, which I used before, in order to get CSS to register again. It wouldn't do so even when I started CSS manually. The accounts stayed at status yellow, and CSS apparently didn't even try to register for some reason.</p>

<p>As to the changes in r1051, I don't use G722. The minimum set of codecs I tried with is GSM, PCMA and PCMU, in that order. To no avail. So it is probably the change at line 300 that breaks things at least on my SGS2. The line was commented out before, perhaps for a good reason.</p>

<p>So once this is fixed I'm ready to try out the change made in r1054.</p></markdown-widget>

If I had a good reason for commenting it out, I'd have removed the line or added a comment around it to explain why it should not be used ;). 
Besides, if you are just upgrading from r1050 to r1051 this code should not be executed at all. </p>

<p>So the problem is somewhere else ;). 
The only other thing that can change excepted my code is the webRTC code that directly comes from google and sounds they broke my builds.
I'll check that and give you feedback, but you're right r1055 at least is broken - when you see that the build size is only 2.3Mo it means that the native library was not built in, and there is no chance this build works ;).</p>

CSS run for several hours. and I moved form one WiFi location to another. When I arrived to the last location I've noticed that CSS is not registered (there is no its icon in top bar). I waited for a long time - no luck. There is no attempts to register at all. Checked with OSMonitor and have noticed, that there are two processes running:
1. com.csipsimple. Start time: 15:53 (time when new version of CSS was launched)
2. com.sipsimple:sipStack. Start time: 18:30 (time when I arrived to new WiFi location)</p>

<p>I suppose that both processes have to have the same start time. Right? If so, why the second one indicates its start time approximately at the time, when I arrived to the last WiFi location and discovered that it's not registered now? Does that mean that sipStack was down (crashed) and then restarted?</p>

<p>And the second question. Do you have a procedure to restore inter-process communication channel between those two processes in case when one is restarted (sipStack)? If there is no such specific procedure (reuse the old connection channel) - it could be the reason why CSS is not registered at that time. Please verify that it's working - intentionally kill/crash sipStack and restart it back again and see if CSS will register itself. If there is no such procedure and you're not going to implement it for whatever reason - the only solution is to kill main CSS process too and then restart them both... Keeping CSS running while it's not even try to register itself is not a solution.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>About restart stuff, actually in one case you're right, but most of the time, that's not the way it works.
sipStack process is about the sip service only and the root process is about the UI. I've separated the two process cause it could help with memory management. 
However, it does not changes the way things works : the sip service is restarted when connection changes. (So it could explain why the start time is different) and it is stopped when there is no connection available anymore. It is automatically restarted when networks changes (independantly of the UI thread) and it is also started when the UI thread explicetly ask for a start/restart. (when you go in settings and go back and when you start the dialer activity).</p>

<p>It was already the case in previous version but was not seen by user since everything was in the same process.</p>

<p>The only case it can behaves the way you fear is when :
 - the app is configured to run only for outgoing.
 - the sip service crashes while the dialer UI is suspended (you quit it using home instead of back button or you didn't quit it at all).
 -&gt; at this point sip service can be not started when you resume the dialer UI. (I'll fix that by checking state on resume).
On all other case the service process ~should~ be independant of the other process - and that's safer all the more so as, csipsimple can be used in plugin mode by other apps without having to start csipsimple UI at all.</p>

<p>However, possible that it crashed in your case : reason why I'd like to get logs cause else I can't guess what really happened. 
I've already seen some crashed with my new timer implementation in pjsip. I'll investigate that in next days, but if you have logs it can be very helpful for me.</p>

<p>It is also possible that there is something completely different that make the sipStack process not restarting correctly (something that block it somewhere). For this reason too, logs can help me to understand what's happening.
But anyway the goal is not to link it to the UI process. It should be independant. </p>

<p>@steve : weird that it does not work on your gingerbread device, I made most of my tests on 2.3.x devices. Can you collect and send me some logs so that I can see why it does not register. </p>

<p>Thx to all for your tests and ideas, it is very valuable :D !</p></markdown-widget>

I would like to thank Regis for the great work. I would say that it works much more better for me too. I still experience some issue with the registration but I think it is due to something different. For a couple of times I see the usual error 403 Forbidden which Regis fixed a long time ago. But this time it just keeps showing the error and not registering (but still trying). I have to go to settings and than go back and everything works fine from this point on. (without changing anything). The other thing is that sometimes the icon disappears but the sip is still connected because I can make and receive calls. The problem is that I cannot get logs because I do not know in which cases this happens. It may happen once a week or everyday. There isn't any pattern.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>It does nothing really different from sipdroid. The sip stack is slightly different but it's still SIP. <em>HOWEVER</em> I do not recommand to use two sip apps at the same time on one phone for 3 reasons. 
First, a sip application listen on TCP/UDP ports of the phone. If the two application listen on same port, it will just break one of the two apps. In CSipSimple, by default, it choose a random free port so should be fine. But if you changed it to 5060 or are migrating from an older version it may overlap with sipdroid that force 5060.
The second point, is that many sip providers only allow <em>ONE</em> sip client at a time to be registered on one sip account. So if you are registered somewhere else, you may break the other registration.
The last point is about audio resources, apps may lock audio resources and prevent other app to get access to audio layer.</p>

<p>Else, I've just fixed a bug with timers that may explain crashes observed in latests versions - espacially on network changes. 
It will be produced automatically tonight. I'm still trying to debug a problem with reset of settings. If you observe this behavior I'm interested by logs :). -symptom is that you see the first setting screen when starting dialer while you have already configured that once.</p></markdown-widget>

I'm producing a build that at least should avoid some crash cases, maybe it will help with this problem too. I noticed that after a crash so maybe it's linked.</p>

<p>Maybe it will also help with Steven's problem, even if in his case sounds the server does not reply at all.
@steven : are you sure that your mobile data connection allow you to do sip? Sometimes some mobile carrier allow sip only under some antennas. 
In fact, I never see reply from the sip server in logs, just like if it did never receive the packets sent by the app. This occurs most of the time when the carrier has a firewall or some equipement to avoid SIP over mobile data. For example, here, in France 2 out of 3 carrier blocks SIP over mobile data. 
Or, it could also be linked to what I fixed in my latest commit, but if so, I think that it would be more random.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Scenario:
1) Connected to LAN at home - CSS is registered. 2) Went to another WiFi spot - CSS is registered, I've made couple of test calls - everything is OK. 3) Returned back to home LAN - CSS doesn't send any registration requests. I started CSS's log, waited for 1h - nothing. I've turned WiFi off on the phone and then turned it back on - nothing again. Stopped the log and I don't see any messages, associated with PJSUA. </p>

<p>Is PJSUA module somehow stuck? And for how long? Waited for the nest 2h and wrote this post... I guess it's stuck indefinitely. "Account" shows yellow bar and message "Inactive" with account, that should be registered by now.</p>

<p>Why PJSUA doesn't react on system notifications like this one (from the log):
D/ConnectivityService(   84): handleConnect() networkinfo=NetworkInfo: type: WIFI[], state: CONNECTED/CONNECTED</p>

<p>My guess - the problem is with PJSUA, that can't survive frequent CONNECTED / DISCONNECTED notifications. May be it has sent some request to SIP server and just waits for a reply, which, as it may wrongly expect, will always come back. And it doesn't... In any case, it should <em>always</em> reset all its status, when it gets DISCONNECTED / CONNECTED message(s) from the OS. That's the only way to make it work more or less reliable.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>How it's supposed to debug the issue, if there is no data in the log??? </p>

<p>Talking about Android's log - the guys who developed it have absolutely no idea what are they doing and why. There is no time stamps, almost no meaningful messages, just a dump of a garbage, repeating the same meaningless lines again and again... Need an example? Here is just one line (repeated 104 times per the log):
"I/global  (  525): Default buffer size used in BufferedReader constructor. It would be better to be explicit if an 8k-char buffer is required." </p>

<p>Sorry for the frustration about the Android's log, but how to find out why the process "com.csipsimple:sipStack" is getting stuck and how to make it start running again without applying a third party tools?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>1st point : I really care about this problem. </p>

<p>2nd point : I develop CSipSimple on my free time night and week ends. It's a project I did for myself first and released to share with any kind people that want to play and contribute with it. Maybe it sounds to you something professional, but it's not. It's made of feedback and help of users. Sipdroid is developed by the company behind pbxes.org, and is very linked to their service. (and there is even bug they maintain to keep compatibility with their server). There is team working all day long on their product.</p>

<p>3rd point : Nightly builds available here (<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a>) are as their name suggest nightly builds that reflects the current development status. As the rest of the project it's opened to everyone so that users can play with it. It sometimes helps to solve issues because it contains bug fixes, but there is also regressions sometimes.</p>

<p>4th point : You seems to have "good" technical advice about which sip stack is the best... Did you think about contributing the opensource project? Any contribution is welcome, and one that would fix this issue will be very welcome ;).</p>

<p>5th point : I'm not sure your advise is very good about sip stack. I have considered integrating imsdroid stack and linphone stack but never sipdroid's one (actually it's not a stack since many things are inside the android part). You should have a look to imsdroid and linphone which are very good community driven opensource projects. I don't force anybody to use CSipSimple. It can becomes better if community raise. I hope so because many sip provider has forks based on csipsimple so maybe one of them will contribute some fix for this.</p>

<p>6th point : This issue is absolutely not linked to pjsip but to my own code. Every stack needs a glue to be ported to a platform. And this problem is linked to my glue. Other professional apps such as Bria use pjsip too. If I had a full day to work on csipsimple probably it would be much more better, but I have only 1 or 2 hours a day dispatched on my free time. </p>

<p>To conclude, of course if you are looking for some "professional" app, csipsimple is absolutely not the right project. You should ignore it instead of making me depressed seeing guys spit on my work. If you are looking for a project community driven and where contribution are welcome and made for all users -not only the one of one sip provider- by users it's the right place however ;). </p>

<p>I don't mean to be rude, I just want to made clear the "goal" of the project and try to make understand that in this kind of project only constructive feedback is welcome. Those who spit on developers that just wants to contribute something to users are not welcome. If it was a professional app, I would find less chocking to see such feedback because there is a whole support team, validation team and so on that could reply, investigate and try to report to developer valuable information to improve the software. But here, all time I loose trying to explain goal of the project and giving feedback on my development progress is time that I do not spend improving the software. The only thing you can do is make me think that I'm spending my time for guys that do not understand the goal of the project. And trust me, it does not really encourage to spend this time.</p>

<p>Also, don't worry I read comments even if I don't always reply, so all very valuable feedback raised -thanks @yok and @krolaw that gives very valuable reproduction scenario and logs- is taken into account. I don't always reply because of lack of time but I always investigate logs.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I don't know how important was the change in r1252 (fix for issue 1564, considering Ethernet as WiFi), but the result so far is positive. CSS gets registered as soon as phone gets connected to WiFi... Before that CSS may stuck on event of connecting to a new WiFi and sit there until I kill the process. And so far it survived several re-connections without that big problem :)</p>

<p>Now we may start talking about other issues with CSS ... ;) </p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>The changes that probably impact this issue is r1249 and it becomes usable with r1258.</p>

<p>In fact, I previously used the method of the stock android sip application to stay registered. They used some hysteresis method to wait 2 sec in order to be sure the wifi network is up. However they've changed that in android 4.0. As consequence in r1249, I commited what I had under testing integrating their new method -- which is basically what we had in csipsimple before integration the stock sip app way minus the change to flag the ongoing notification as a background running app to avoid kills from android.</p>

<p>So glad to hear that it helps. My fear is that it's not backward compatible with older android versions. That's why I have to do some basic regression test before to tell it's fixed. But if some have time here to do some tests with latest binary it will be welcome.</p>

<p>Also, another point is that this method may consume more data than previous one that did the job only if IP changed (but was also potentially one root cause of the problem, and more with android 4.0 that does not announce IP the same way). The r1258 should be there to at least reduce the double start when starting the service first, but I think that anyway the app will try to restart sip more often all the more so as 3G network is allowed.
So I'm also interested in changes in data consumption and battery consumption you get with latest version.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Both 3 &amp; 5 cases can happen
when the network(3G) doesn't respond to CSS's registration request.
The no response situation can happen when the network is unstable or
registration request is sent before the network becomes stable 
(between Wifi Off and 3G On).</p>

<p>In this case, 
CSS waits forever without retry even though network becomes alive...
(when other internet applications work...)</p>

<p>I guess, from this phenomenon, CSS does not have a retry function 
when the response time becomes too much long.
This kind of network error should be handled in real network situation... </p>

<p>I hope this simple idea can help..</p>

<p>When CSS is connected through Wifi and I'm watching the account screen.
Then, an account becomes Inactivated immediately if I close Wifi connection.
This is normal operation...</p>

<p>When CSS is connected through 3G and I'm watching the account list screen.
Then, if I close 3G connection, the account's status is NOT changed
even though the connection icon disappears in the display bar at the top of the screen. </p>

<p>This is a strange behavior ONE.</p>

<p>At this time, if I touch the account icon, it becomes inactivated as expected.
Then, if touch the account icon again to make it be registered, 
the account's status is changed to connected immediately even though 
the 3G connection is closed now... </p>

<p>This is a strange behavio TWO.</p>

<p>from strange behavior ONE and TWO, 
I guess ... 
1. There's a hole in 3G connection detection procedure.
2. because of 1, some state machines in CSS are not synchronized in specific situation...
3. And this is the reason why CSS looks like it does not retry registration
when request time is over. Actually, at the moment, CSS THINKS that 3G is connected, so it just waits just like 2 above.</p>

<p>Later, I found that in both 3 &amp; 5 error cases, if I toggle the account activation, 
the strange behavior TWO happened..
So, there can be a connection 3 &amp; 5 error cases and strange behaviors...</p>

Sorry if I don't reply immediately but it helps me a lot to reproduce the issue on my side :).
It also gives me good clues about what could be the problem. As you guessed, I think that's something with the detection of 3G. I recently switched my main test device to 4.0 and I think that the behavior of 3G detection is different than it was in 2.x (btw, even the stock sip app changed). I naively followed these changes, but it probably breaks things for older device (the stock sip app doesn't have this problem since they always only target one android version ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The malfunction of 3 &amp; 5 might be because of CSS's system function call crash...
The reason why I guess like this is ... </p>

<p>when it is in off line and no retry... 
strange phenomena happen.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I can't stop the CSS application from task manager... 
It says because of something is running .. I have to terminate forcefully.. </p></li>
<li><p>If I plug-in a ear-phone jack, the mp3 sound sould be out through earphone... 
Then, in this crash situation, it doesn't work. the sound comes out through speaker.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>from these phenomena, i guess some system function called by CSS is not returned or 
crashed... because ??? I don't know... 
anyway, it is related with SOUND function .. I guess.. </p>

<p>Thanks.</p></markdown-widget>

When awaken wifi would re-establish connection then CSS as well.  Sometimes during a long chat wifi connection icon would disapppear and a pause ensues til wifi re-establish connection.  My question:  if wifi signal drops and phone is in sleep state would wifi be able to re-establish connection like when I am using the phone?

<p>I'm using the nightlies, and I use TLS connection to an Asterisk server, from behind a NAT router. I thought it was the phone sleeping, so I tried an experiment: I had Tasker wake the phone with dim screen for 3 seconds every 10 minutes. The registration stayed on all day yesterday (when I was occasionally using the phone for checking email, etc), but overnight, with the tasker task running, it lost registration. When I woke the phone in the morning it had no CSS notification icon, and when I ran CSS it re-registered.</p>

<p>Wifi sleep = never, CSS Lock Wifi = on, phone was on charger all night.</p>

<p>This makes me believe that it is NOT the phone's sleep state that causes this loss of registration. </p></markdown-widget>

This seems to use a bit more battery but it makes my Samsung Exhibit II hold the registration for many hours now. I suspect that without the wifi high perfs lock the qualification "pings" from Asterisk are not received reliably or in sufficient time, and Asterisk drops the registration.</p>

<p>I am going to increase registration time to 450 seconds and try to bump TCP keepalives up as well maintaining high perf lock and see what happens.</p></markdown-widget>

Issue 1697 analysis reveal that some servers (in this case pbxes.org one) behaves weird when re-transmission is made by sip client. 
By default the application will retransmit packets after 500ms if no reply. In case phone is asleep and network latency is big you can reach this case and the registration will not be able to complete and when you come in csipsimple the account is marked as registration failure (red). 
A workaround is to change the retransmission value to some higher one (for example 1000ms). It will be default for pbxes.org wizard now. 
Let me know if you observe same thing on other sip server/provider.</p></markdown-widget>

The same thing happens if I leave my wifi area and come back. I tried with both Callcentric and Iptel, and upon reactivating wifi, both accounts appear to time out after about 30 seconds of "registering." I'm running the latest stable version from the Play Store, which is reported as 1.02.00R2330 on a Huawei MyTouch Q. In case it helps, my wifi router is a D-Link DIR-601 running OpenWRT 12.09, which usually gives me a very stable and reliable connection for most other applications. The only work-around I found is to disconnect CSS, deactivate wifi, reactivate wifi, wait 30 seconds to a minute for the connection to be fully established and all applications to see it and then rerun CSS, which appears to reset something to the point where it can detect and use the wifi connection. I tried going into settings and backing out without disconnecting or cycling the wifi radio, but the accounts still hang on "registering," this time for only about 10 to 15 seconds before timing out, as if there is no connection to the internet. However, other applications such as e-mail apps are getting a connection. Best I can figure is that there is something missing in the wifi detection in CSS,. Either that, or the MyTouch Q is doing something different from other devices when the wifi is connected.</p></markdown-widget>

It seems I don't need to disconnect and rerun CSS to register my accounts once wifi is connected. The easiest work-around on my device is to activate my mobile data connection prior to leaving my wifi area and to deactivate it just before reentering the wifi area. Failing to deactivate mobile data upon entering a wifi zone causes the registration errors/timeouts  I describe above for all accounts. If I then deactivate both mobile data and wifi and then reactivate wifi, my accounts register almost immediately without any further trouble. Hopefully this info will be helpful in tracking down this issue. Thanks for the great work.</p></markdown-widget>

CSipSimple registers without a problem, but after some time (several minutes to hours) while on wifi the registration drops.

This happens every time, but the amount of time until it happens is variable.  My best guess is that it has to do with moving between different access points on the same network, but it's just a guess (I rearranged my network so that my home network only had one access point, and the issue didn't arise - but I've only tried this on one occasion so far).

I'll be brief as I don't have any new details to add that weren't covered by prior commenters. I'm using CSS with Callcentric, and the only unusual thing is that for the first 6 to 12 months I used CSS I didn't see a problem, but it was sometime after about 6 months ago when Callcentric added support for extensions and I set up a dedicated extension for CSS that I started noticing Callcentric's dashboard indicating CSS being unregistered. This could be coincidental, or an artifact that prior to Callcentric supporting multiple extensions, if you used multiple SIP clients, whichever one registered last, won, and you couldn't easily tell if one client had stopped registering.</p>

<p>What can I do to help debug this? I've enabled logging (its in the help menu, for those asking in prior comments).</p></markdown-widget>

This is basically what happens.</p>

<p>CSS stops registering for 1 hour but during this 1 hour it keeps sending the SUBSCRIBE event to the server for the account (every 4 minutes or so). So CSS is alive, the WiFi connection too but somehow CSS is lost and does not send a REGISTER. The server enforced the expiration to 60 seconds so it should retry after every minute but it does not.</p>

<p>After 1 hour CSS changes the local port and starts registering again. So there must be something wrong in CSS. I would like to help but I understand it is almost impossible to reproduce this issue. I have 3 tablets in chargers running CSS all the time with WiFi never sleep policy. All of them should be ringing for incoming calls but sometimes some of them does not due to the not REGISTERed issue. </p>

I increased T1 delay to 2000 ms. But even though it's now more reliable, I still had a disconnect when my wifi internet was having trouble yesterday.</p>

<p>I think the better solution would be for CSIPSimple to re-try registration at a larger interval (every 5 or 10 minutes to save battery) in case the internet route is down intermittently. Currently it goes into a dead-end state. There's no way to know unless the user turns on device &amp; checks the status bar. Even then it's not too obvious if there's a lot of icons up there. A red icon or an audio alert would also help when troubleshooting disconnect/re-registeration issues. A red icon should be when it's setup to connect to a SIP server but can't. Missing icon should be when it's not configured to connect - no SIP account, not setup for wifi, 3G, etc or when app is not running.</p></markdown-widget>

After that no more registration attempts are made for some reason. So as a workaround, I try to make sure now that the CSS main app always keeps running in the background and is listed among the recent apps. Of course this is still not 100% reliable as Android may close apps by itself when memory is low.</p></markdown-widget>
