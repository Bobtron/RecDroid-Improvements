I'll also need to know what SIP provider you are using and what codecs are enabled and supported by your SIP provider. Also if it's 100% reproducible or random.
And finally what is the ROM you are using ? CM7? And if there is a sip account configured in the stock SIP application available on 2.3?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As for the "force close" in fact was an ANR (application non responding). I'll try to debug that.</p>

<p>Regarding other logs what's strange is that invite is sent but there is no replies from the sip server. That's really weird. 
As consequence the SIP stack waits for a reply from the server and timeout long time after to be sure there is no replies and provide a consistent state to the other side.</p>

<p>The strange point is that it seems to work on the second try you did while what is sent by CSipSimple is exactly the same.  This kind of problem are really hard to debug. Sometimes it's due to something that happens wrong on the other side but could be due to something in the pjsip stack configuration too. As it comes after the upgrade I think more about something on CSipSimple side... but I don't know really what could be the faulty setting I changed recently :S</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Update:
I think I have isolated the problem.
I know it has nothing to do with ROM because I switched from 2.3 to another 2.3 and then went to 2.2 and that didn't had any effect.</p>

<p>As i said I am using 2 sip providers and now I am sure that the problem is not with the rom or with CipSimple. "sipme" sip provider works  great with no "black screens" but "rynga" provider brings the "black screen" every few calls.</p>

<p>I also tired using "bria" sip app, and got the same result, every few calls the phone on the other side rings but we cant hear each other, the only differences is that in "bria" I don't get the "black screen" Instead I have to pouch many times the "hang up" button and then after a while the call ends.</p>

<p>when I use "rynga" on my "ringa" native app i don't experience any special problems,some times the call doesn't get connected and then I hang up and dial again.</p>

<p>then again all my problems withe "rynga" and CsipSimple started right after the last update, maybe its a coincidence that the guys at "rynga" did something(bad) to the sip service in the same day that you updated the app.</p></markdown-widget>

this kind of handling would allow testing to exclude the problem is related with proximity sensor.
"After timeout (5sec the first time, 20sec if after a manual unlock), lock overlay is shown. Double tapping on it hide this overlay."</p>

<p>This kind of workarround was proposed for another issue as well
