<p>The tablet start to go slowly whitouth any reason. Some times after a long time in a sleep mode, sometimes even when the application is closed.
I'm sure that this problem come from Csipsimple because i install it more than once and i already reset the tablet a couple of time. The problem start just after i install this program.
Sometimes it continue also after i unistall it.</p>

<p>I istal the program from android market, and also i instal the program downloading from this website. No difference.</p>

<p>I don't know if the problem is a library o incompatibility with my tablet.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The weird point is that you still have the problem after the uninstall. If so would mean there is some third party app or something in stock ROM that is put in a weird state by CSipSimple. 
Since there's a lot of setting that may impact other apps/stock rom apps, I think that the best would be if I can try with a tablet direclty connected on my dev environement. I'll ask to kind sip providers that use to help me when I need harware to test on ;). Thanks a lot for reporting.</p>

<p>Maybe, just if you can do just a quick last test with this version :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple-0.02-03.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple-0.02-03.apk</a></p>

<p>It is the previous version (before 0.03-00), it could help me to know whether it would be a regression added in latest version or something more linked to a third party app incompatibility on your device. It could also help me to know if that's about some recent change. I did several enhancement to ensure the app is connected when you select "Always available" option and this could typically be something not correctly handled by one samsung ROM.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>MMmmmm, interesting. Sounds not directly linked ot csipsimple however. CSipSimple just increases the fact there is something that becomes crazy in background.</p>

<p>I think that one key point is that your tablet is GSM capable. Was not the case on the one I tested on 6 month ago and the one that other users I talked with had.</p>

<p>Regarding logs there is a lot of events raised by your system about the wifi and the available hotspot arround you. Normally the OS should do that few times but here it seems to do that a lot of time. Since CSipSimple is registered to this kind of event (in order to keep the registration with sip server up to date if necessary), it is launched a lot of times. In fact, in logs there is few lines written by csipsimple, but a lot by the wifi driver card and android wifi manager. There is also a lot about on wifi access point notification which leads to a lot of sound device openning. But regarding csipsimple logs it look likes what it should look like on normal devices.</p>

<p>However, even if Csipsimple does really few things, I think that the simple fact that there is a raise of a wifi event on android system, and that this event inform csipsimple, pledge the CPU.</p>

<p>The question is, what is the root cause of these events?... 
I guess it will not only impact CSipSimple but could impact other apps that cares about connection reachability dynamically (it may also drain your battery faster).</p>

<p>Maybe it's a bug on samsung side, would not be the first (there is already a necessary workaround automatically applied for calls audio routing). </p>

<p>Did you experimented this problem with other SIP apps ? (Most of SIP/VoIP apps needs to register this kind of event).
Also, it could be interesting to test over a wifi connection. Since the events I see in logs should never be raised while in wifi it may behaves differently.
If my first analysis is correct you should try to investigate independantly of csipsimple the root cause of the problem. It's not so annoying if you can't use csipsimple (there is many other cool SIP softphone on android :) : linphone, imsdroid, sipdroid) (my goal is just to make users happy, if that's with another opensource software, it does not really matter for me ;) ). But would be more annoying if it's something about your ROM : would mean your battery drains faster than it should, and that's more annoying for you.</p></markdown-widget>

So I tried other program and I have the same problem.
At this point I think that the problem is not the program but the system.
My tablet is a brand tablet from turkcell (Turkey).
I think they lock this kind of program in order to don't use cheaper
calling instead their normal mobile phone line.
I know that it can be strange, but I can assure you that is possible. They
can do it.
In Turkey you are not really free to do whatever you want.
You can't even buy a mobilephone out from the country because they lock it.</p>

<p>I can't explain the pro lem in other way.
Moreover, regarding the usage of the battery, I can confirm that I don't
have any problem. As I use the tablet the battery is off after 2 or 3 days.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the support.

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi,
Ok, so my guess was probably not totally wrong.</p>

<p>I don't think they block this kind of problem in this way. Actually there is much much more efficient ways to block SIP and voice over IP directly on the network rather than slowing down some app on some specific platform. Here is France main mobile carriers blocks SIP, but they do that in the network, and running such apps does not slow down the system.</p>

<p>Besides regarding your logs it sounds something on the ROM. Maybe your carrier did some crappy thing but I do think it was intentional. At least I hope :/. However, I trust you that they can, break something is so hard to do ;).
The point is that you notice that now with a voice over IP application, but regarding logs, I think that it could affect other apps.
There is probably one android system part that is broken in the ROM and I think that any application that use this system part will result in the same kind of slowing. I really hope that turkcell didn't broke intentionnaly one part of android.</p>

<p>Did they planned to upgrade the firmware of your tablet? I thought that there were an official upgrade from samsung to android 2.3. Maybe turkcell still block the update...? But maybe if you simply plug the tablet to your PC and use samsung's software (Kies if I don't mistake), You'll get an upgrade on your tablet to android 2.3. Did you tried that or the android version is blocked by your mobile provider ?
Cause after a quick search on french forums sounds that the android 2.2 ROM of the galaxy tab 7'' with 3G was very buggy and that these problems vanished when they updated to android 2.3.</p></markdown-widget>
