<p>Latest as of this post.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>It would be cooler instead of a 100% duty cycle on the partial-wake lock you guys did something lighter.  I mean all you have to do is wake up to see if there are any pending packets/TCP coming in [to receive calls].  Even if all you did is wake every 100ms that'd be more than enough.</p>

<p>Also, it would be handy to have a quick button to toggle partial-wake on/off.  The way I use csip is to enable the wake-lock when I'm at the office with the phone plugged in and to turn it off when I'm on the road.  It would be nice to be able to toggle it without digging through menus.</p></markdown-widget>

If you do not enable this option the app will behaves a correct way regarding wake lock and just enable the cpu when it's needed.</p>

<p>Enabling the "partial wake lock" option is <em>an expert option</em> and should be done only if you know what you are doing and if you are in a situation where the phone is buggy regarding incoming packets (and it's the case for some phones).</p>

<p>I'd like to add that waking up things every 100ms is not a good idea at all because when you know how cpu lock works, you understand that a short cycle of wakes is exactly equivalent to always wake as the phone waits some time before going in sleep mode.</p>

<p>So nothing to do here. The current standard behavior is the good one, and if you don't want battery drain, do not enable workaround option that explicitly drain battery faster...</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Nexus 4 has a bug from google (it's known and accepted by google, there is an open issue on their tracker on their 4.3 builds).
So the bug is not to be tracked on csipsimple. It's something that google must fix.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the only solutions are (at choice):
use udp with high value of keep alive
use a custom rom with a fix from community (If I don't mistake some guys did a fix on this problem)
use a short ka interval (that simulate exactly what you describe, but will not let phone go to sleep mode, so should not introduce big gain in battery savings).
use the partial wake lock and have battery drain faster. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, no other solution are possible. 
Reducing wake lock interval, will actually do exactly the same than 100% wake lock (due to the way android manages cpu locks). Having to big interval will result in loosing calls (because usually sip server doesn't wait indefinitely for client to reply with 100 trying).</p>

<p>You can simulate a wake lock interval shorter by simply reducing the KA interval. Each time a KA must be send, the phone is wake up. 
But as I said, a too short KA interval will result in phone always wake up (so same thing than keep awake). A too long, in case of buggy nexus4 will result in call not received at all.</p>

<p>For more details about one part of the problem opened on google side:
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=42272">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=42272</a>
It doesn't only affect csipsimple but all apps receiving tcp event in background... the shame is that it also affect google apps such as gtalk ! When I receive a gtalk notification on my galaxy s3 it's instant, on nexus 4 it has a very very long delay. For chat it's not critical, but for phone calls it is.
The nexus 4 also have some problem with sip due to some bad contrack rule they added that prevent too big tcp packet. I guess you are not affected, but if you see one day a 408 timeout error while using tcp on nexus4, it could be this problem. Well... N4 is the first time google worked with LG, so maybe we should be indulgent, but weird they do not react quickly and provide fixes on these critical issues.</p></markdown-widget>

Just FYI though with the KA set to 30, wifi always on, and wifi optimizations off, on the Nexus 4 with Jellybean it seems to be much better on the battery [just over 1% of battery/hr] versus 3-5%/hr with the wakelock.</p>
