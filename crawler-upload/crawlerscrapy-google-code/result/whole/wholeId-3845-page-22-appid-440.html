<p>1.) Put g722 and g711a/u in the list.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>Even when I put g711a at the top, g722 will be used when in the list
When the remote station does not support g722, csipsimples should use the next supported codec, but it still uses g722, therefore no audio is transfered or the audio is played with wrong samplingrate on the remote station.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>latest trunk, HTC Desire on 2.3.3</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>fritzbox sip server and sipgate, checked other sipclients, they behave normally (use next supported codec when is g722 is not available.)</p></markdown-widget>

Other apps does not have this feature so you may have missed that point.</p>

<p>If you are sure of you configuration, could you provide me some logs (see the HowToCollectLogs wiki page).</p>

<p>In fact there is usually two ways to manage codecs priority. Now (in recent versions), CSipSimple behaves to consider its own list as the one that should be taken into account with the higher priority. But previously it had a lower priority than the one of the remote side.</p>

<p>In fact to understand how codec priorities works you have to understand how sip SDP works.</p>

<p>When you invite somebody, you send him the list of the codec you support (with the order you prefer). The other side, choose in this list.</p>

<p>So depending how both client are configured results could vary.
For example if you receive a call from somebody that tell you what are the codecs they prefer, you can either choose to follow their preferred codec or choose on your list of codecs the one you prefer and that is supported by the other side.</p>

<p>When you make a call, you can do less things. You can only send to the remote party what are your preferred codec and let them choose.</p>

<p>If you provide me logs, I'll be able to know exactly in which case you are, and if there is actually something that is going wrong in CSipSimple (actually in pjsip).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>It's due to the fact pjsip does not manage multiple codecs offers.
Your sip provider replies without choosing any codec. In this case, pjsip tries to force one codec (the prefered one - g722).
For some reason your sip server refuse this and send only G711. (rtp packets are of type 8 (g711) instead of being 9 (g722).</p>

<p>Sounds like if the server is not RFC compliant regarding SDP negociation.
The limitation on pjsip side exists (and should be fixed by pjsip guys), but even with this limitation, it behaves a RFC compliant way the sip server does not understand.</p>

<p>So on my side nothing can be done. It is either relevant of the pjsip project (the sip stack on which csipsimple relies for now - more sip stack support is planned in the future) or on your server side that does not behaves a consistent way.
If you can produce me one more log (direct send using email instead of publishing on the issue list, it's better for your privacy and provide me more infos). I'd like to understand how other sip stack could work with this cause regarding logs I have here the remote side does not support g722 at all in the second sdp offer they send while refusing the force of the g722.
Unless your provider do independent flows, and that others sip stack just fake you and make you think there is g722 both way, while there is g722 out and g711 in ;).</p></markdown-widget>

My codec priority for 3g is set as follows: GSM, G729, G722. Incoming calls work fine. outgoing calls to g722 clients work great. outgoing calls to voip.ms (only support gsm,g729 and pcmu) fail every time on 3g. On wifi everything works. On 3g, if i take 722 out of the available codec options, calls go out perfectly gain. </p>

UDP packet can be blocked by network equipement if packet size is too big. Announcing an extra codec increase INVITE packet size. If your 3G carrier is very strict it could drop invite packet and your call will timeout.
To reduce packet size the "Compact mode" option (in expert setting mode) could help to reduce size, but it has to be supported by SIP provider/remote party else you'll observe worse things.</p></markdown-widget>
