                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Make a SIP call using csipsimple over a cell network (4G, 3G, etc)
2. Disconnect the cell network (do not hang up)
3. csipsimple continues the call, until the Hang Up button is manually clicked.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
When the 'Hang Up' button is clicked, because the cell network connection was already disconnected, it appears that the VoIP provider/SIP system did not receive a BYE for this call as the network connection was dropped by my cell phone.  In this case, a 5 minute call was billed as a 6.5 hour call.</p>

<p>This resulted in the SIP system continuing to bill my account as the SIP/VoIP provider did not receive a BYE to transmit to the terminating end.  They were billed for this call as well.</p>

<p>In cases in which our customers experience this, the SIP/VoIP provider highly recommends that csipsimple use session timers which avoid such conditions from impacting their account balances.</p>

<p>Session timers specify an interval (a minimum of 120 seconds) which the customer system and carrier checks to see if the current call is still active. If it is is not active, then the call is terminated immediately</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
csipsimple 0.04-04 r1916 running on Android 4.1.1, Samsung SGH-T999 on T-Mobile</p>

So, if the remote support session timers it should be active and working. If remote doesn't support rfc4028, it will obviously not work.</p>

<p>In CSipSimple, you can configure the session timers value (min-se/session expiration period) in expert setting mode (global settings &gt; network &gt; sip protocol). 
By default it's min-se = 90 and session expiration = 1800 (you can reduce it if you find it too high for your case -- especially if it's paid service)</p>

<p>If you need per account setting, I can give access to the option to force session timers in account setting (in expert wizard probably). 
But I fear that if it's not currently activated with your sip provider the only result you'll get is no call established at all.</p>

<p>(for the record; about the setting(s) I could add in the user interface : <a href="http://www.pjsip.org/pjsip/docs/html/group__PJSUA__LIB__BASE.htm#gaf352829cc383112c4ce4da58a4d0b37e">http://www.pjsip.org/pjsip/docs/html/group__PJSUA__LIB__BASE.htm#gaf352829cc383112c4ce4da58a4d0b37e</a> --default is optional)
So let me know if you are interested in these options, I can add this as enhancement.
If I misunderstood something in the bug report and you are referring something different than rfc4028 or noticed it doesn't work properly let me know, it will be treated as defect but I would need some logs (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page)</p>

<p>Some side point : may I suggest that your sip server check RTP/RTCP streams and cuts the connection before when no activity detected on stream. 
The should be robust to sip clients that lost connection and doesn't support session timers (which is not the case of csipsimple). 
Session timers are mainly useful if you are not on media stream path, but sounds in your case you gateway to pstn network and are on media path. BTW, this suggestion is also made in introduction of the rfc4028 and standardized in rfc3550 as linked in rfc4028.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Thanks for the quick response.  I checked the session expiration setting and it was the default 1800 seconds.  However the call went for over 20000 seconds (only the first 5 minutes were actually active).  The SIP provider is Flowroute, and they claim to support session timers, so it should have taken effect.  I've asked them to see if they can check RTP/RTCP streams as you suggested, which makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p></markdown-widget>

I never actually tested this feature. But since it comes from pjsip (the native sip stack behind csipsimple) which is pretty robust and used in many other sip clients (desktop and mobile), I'm pretty confident. 
However, it's not to exclude there is some bug or that I pass some wrong parameter that de-configure the sip stack. 
So if you find something weird after checking with their proxy, tell me; we will investigate deeper and report to pjsip guys if necessary.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Flowroute checked the logs on some calls and confirmed that the session timers worked:</p>

<p>"I was able to confirm that your system is properly sending the compact form of Session-Expires setting up call session timers."</p>

<p>So it should be fine to close this issue.  The actual issue seems to be on Flowroute's side.  They apparently can't implement RFS3550 because they use Direct Media Delivery (DMD) and they don't relay media (they only see signaling traffic).  The call was properly terminated by the peering carrier, however, the billing system wasn't able to catch this.  They still need to find a way to end an 'active' call that really isn't active (e.g., check if the SIP client logs out, etc).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></markdown-widget>
