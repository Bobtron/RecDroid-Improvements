* The variant of this Samsung i9000 has another audio implementation than the one I tested on Galaxy S -and that work. However samsung as such an awful audio implementation on this series... that I would not be so much astonished.
* Something goes wrong with the network and/or configuration. </p>

<p>To test if it's the first point, you should maybe try to enable/disable speaker and hold/resume call and see how things goes if nothing is observed, probably something with the second point.
So, if the second one, maybe setting a stun server could help :
Go on setting Settings &gt; Network - Tick Use Stun and fill a stun server on the field bellow. You can use whatever stun server you want it's not necessarily linked to your provider. See <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/STUN">http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/STUN</a> Public Stun server section. 
If it doesn't work, you can also try to use ICE.
If none of this tests helps, you should maybe ensure that there is no firewall between your device and the other party ( or your router doesn't route things).</p>

<p>And finally, you could send me logs (see on the wiki, there is a page about HowToCollectLogs), so that I can maybe understand more what is happening.</p>

<p>What would be really interesting for me too is whether you tried with another android sip phone with the same configuration and the same remote party.</p></markdown-widget>

I Had to add a STUN server and turn ICE on. I can hear with no problem now,
however the voice quality incoming and outgoing was OK, little choppy, even after activating the options to prevent that on the settings menu, I guess it is because of the low bitrate codec, my Voip Phone Service(Inphonex) supports only 3 codecs available on csipsimple, PCMU, PCMA and ilibc. </p>

<p>Iphonex Supports: G711, G729, G726, G723, ILIBC, GSM,
So it would be nice to see some of the higher bitrate codecs that will work with my service provider in future versions of csipsimple.</p>

Well csipsimple already support a lot of codecs. You can configure their priorities in settings, media, codecs
Pcmu =g711
Pcma = g711a
There is also ilbc, gsm, speex,g722...
I have something that work with g729, but I don't want to publish it now due to licensing issues I have with this codec. G726 is planned but will not improve things in your situation.
I get some really good results with ilbc. But you have to ensure that it I is actually the codec chosen on the sip negotiation. So while in call use the i button to see what is the current codec. You can try to disable some codecs in settings if your server always choose pcmu/a. Long click on a codec to do so.</p></markdown-widget>

<ul>
<li><p>The remote party actually support gsm &amp; iLBC, but prefer pcmu. If so, you can try to disable pcmu/pcma from the codec list (long click &amp; Deactivate on a codec row). 
If it's actually unsupported by the remote party, you'll see call "Connecting" and will directly hangup, since codec negotiation has failed. If it succeed, you are probably having a call that use a codec within the non disabled codec list :).</p></li>
<li><p>The remote party or your gateway server (if it's a pstn call) doesn't support these codecs. If so nothing, unfortunately, can be done in CSipSimple to help. 
However, if you get a bad sound quality (I mean choppy sound) with G711, it mean that your network (or more precisely the network between you and the remote party), is not good enough. It's confirmed by the fact using GSM makes things better on local : GSM use a lower bandwidth than G711. 
On a good network CSipSimple provide a good call quality (tested and validated by many people here ;) ). I guess that with your and your remote party network you'll not find any sip application that make the call quality good enough.
If you are interested in codec stuff, you can read this <a href="http://www.speex.org/comparison/">http://www.speex.org/comparison/</a> comparison. CPU usage is not shown on this table, but with your galaxy i9000, will not has a big impact.</p></li>

<p>You need stun because you are probably under a NATed network (with some routers between you and your server/the remote party).
STUN is a service that allow your SIP client to know its public IP and so allow your remote contact or server to send you audio packets. If it's not activated, it's possible that you (your sip client) announce a IP that is unreachable by the remote party... So the remote party will try to send you packet to an IP that it can't reach... and this packets will be lost in the network :)</p>

<p>So under certain network configuration -usually with 3G when data is carried by your carrier- stun or Turn or ICE are needed.</p></markdown-widget>

I forgot I was using wifi!</p>

<p>I've got to agree with you, samsung did a poor job with the audio/mic 
system in the i9000 (it's a shame because the rest of the phone is very 
good).
One thing I noticed is that the other party can't hear me the way I hear 
them. I can hear well, but when I talk, my voice get there broken. When they talk they get a horrible echo too. It doesn't happen only with csipsimple, it 
happens with all others voip apps.
I think it's because the poor mic i9000 has. It's too sensitive and too 
loud... I really don't know.
I will have to wait for froyo 2.2 update to see if samsung will fix this 
system.</p>

<p>Until there... I don't know what I can do to have a good voip app running 
in this phone. You're are the one who is getting close, but I think samsung is not colaborating with you! :)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>That's now included as default parameter in 0.00-13-04 but will not erase your existing settings if you have csipsimple already installed. So you can either uninstall and reinstall version -13-04 or set settings listed in issue 259 by hand and say me how it goes :).</p>

<p>For the micro in fact they used Alsa (a well known linux driver on this mobile). However the implementation of Alsa in android (not done by samsung) doesn't behaves as a standard developer would have expect. Besides they did something really crappy with audio routes that doesn't make things better :).</p>

<p>But your right, the rest of the phone is amazing .... still prefer my Nexus One since more up to date but I'm hesitating in buying one galaxyS... besides would be easier to test on ;)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>One more doubt. After installing 0.00-13-04 I went on setting to check the Mic/Speaker amplification values and both was set as 1. Based on the values posted on issue 259, I'm not sure if you apply these values internally or not, but I manually changed even after 0.00-13-04. Is it necessary?</p>

<p>Thanks again r3gis! I can't believe it's working!</p></markdown-widget>

Making calls here in US, quality is crystal clear. </p>
