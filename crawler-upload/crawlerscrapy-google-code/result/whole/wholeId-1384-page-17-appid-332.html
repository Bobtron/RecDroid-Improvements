well.  So no way to create SD-base version without work with source.  There are some
way to do this and many problem concerned: simplest way to supply, safety/stability

It is subject of special discussion. <br>
Here is my suggestion how to solve issue:
Include to supply additionl uImage ( uImageSD.bin in attachment1 have build from
current source tree ), which have not include ram disk opposite kernel.img.

<p>( Looks that Michael do same, but I could not check - do not know the way to his git )
The supply of this file is a main topic.
This will be enough to build SD-based version from supply by standart procedure:
<a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Android_on_Freerunner">http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Android_on_Freerunner</a>.
The logs is in attachment2.
I want to put result for current stable ( -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 32669879 2009-10-24
11:21 android-on-freerunner-cupcake-0.1.1-sd.tar.gz) in attachment as well, but the
limit 10M not allow to do this. It should be restored to partition 2 of standart (
fat/sd ) prepared SD for freerunner with qi bootloader. Show the way to put it, if
somebody interested in.

  1) about uImage - it is actual now, but you should take in mind that it should be
  build from actual repo of kernel ( no changes in kernel since 12.10 now )
  2) please, send me an example of application, which hang ( I have not access to

  3) from my expirience, typical problem, which produce same errors, is incorrect

  I have not tested "ext2 partion as sdcard", typical is fat/ext2 scheme. So you are

  I do not find any difference yet between SD or NAND based installation, at least at
  daily use. However I have read at some reports and I think myself, that NAND-based
  should work a bit faster than SD-based. But this "bit" may be noticed only by special
  testing. </p>

Thanks for your work on this! I'm trying to reproduce it, so that I can add an option
to the build to build a tarball for SSD installation. I followed your directions and
was able to successfully boot from SD, but I was seeing crashes and exception in the
log that seemed to be caused by permission problems. I plan to do some more work this
evening, but I was interested in whether you have to do anything to get the proper
ownership/permissions on the SD file system.

1) I've been using using your old image, but using the latest one is the same (also 
because there are no recent changes in git...)
2) There's no an application that hangs... Any application can hang in some 
particular situations that I neither can understand since the logcat doesn't say 
anything about that (the market generally works, at the beginning crashed mostly due 
to configuration issues). Sometimes the interface continues to be animated but the 
phone doesn't respond to events and in few seconds also the gui freezes at all...
3) All my /system file have right righs, I've tried also with a chmod 777 /system -R.</p>

<p>About the usage of an ext2 partition, I think that this shouldn't be a problem... 
It's a kernel work, and linux has no problems with all those filesystems... However I 
could try with a vfat too...</p>

<p>Yes I figure too that the NAND version should be faster, also because the interface 
(glamo) bus is shared with the SD card, but also in SD it works well from the 
interface speed point of view.</p></markdown-widget>

  Here is not clear for me am moment. As I understend, we lose permission on a way:
  create image, Mntjffs.sh, cp -R . So right way is to exclude this steps and create
  tarball directly - I am looking at this possibility now, if you will do this, it will
  be great. 
  However this way require a lot work with source. I would like to find simple way to
  get SD-based system, without work with source, becouse in this case a lot of problems
  should be discussed: simplest way to supply, safety/stability
  to work and so.
  For now I do: chmod -R 777 /system , which is not correct, but usefull. At  least for
  my daily used system.</p>

<p>Today I have investigate a problem with file permissions. It is very surpise for me that:
1) After build a fresh subj from current repository we have a normal set of file/dir
permissions ( 755 or 644 .. ) in system directory.
2) After installation current ( NAND ) build we have only 777 for all file/dir 
3) For Michael build we have same.
             So, chmod -R 777 /system is same</p>

<p>Summary:  Our build do not covered by file permission at all.</p>

<p>May be I miss something, but I am surprised.   Could somebody give any explanation?</p></markdown-widget>

aren't affected by this. And I also think that it's mostly a kernel related issue
(looking at this)... Some old posts [1] confirms this behavior in certain situations,
so I figure there's something wrong here.</p>

<p>By the way, there's nothing to describe exactly: randomly when I'm doing some
operations on screen (like browsing, syncing contacts, twitting, writing in forms...
Or also just after that the android launcher screen has booted) suddenly the phone
hangs and rests freezed until I remove the battery :(.</p>

<p>A "fun" thing is that the phone really doesn't freezed, it should be alive since if
it hangs when I'm writing in a form, for example, the cursor continue blinking also
if everything else is completely unresponsive (a similar issue running a game, it
continued animating also if slowly, but it was not controllable)... :o</p>

<p>Maybe we/I could try some different configurations for this: any advices?</p>

<p>By the way, the freeze issue rarely happens in a fresh installation with few

/sdcard pointing to a different mmc partition), but it's hard to say when.
However this makes me think that it seems to be real that the phone hangs when it has 
to perform many read/writes in the SD (and while it does, android doesn't seem able

permissions and the database files in my /data partition (which during the ext2 usage 
were often corrupted by forced reboots) and I noticed really a GREAT stability 
improvement.</p>

<p>So, maybe it's a kernel driver related issue, I don't know, but the ext2 (that I chosen not to stress my card) doesn't seem to perform as expected here.
This seems to be also the cause of the lockups I noticed sometimes when accessing to 
the /sdcard (which still uses an ext2 partition).</p>

<p>Talking about file systems... Few weeks ago phoronix posted a review/benchmark [1] 
where it was underlined that the ext4 file system was the best choice for usb flash 
devices; I don't know if this can be applied to a µSD card, but if it can, I figure 
that we could move to this FS to get better performances.
I've not tested this yet, since months ago the ext4 fs was disabled in OM kernels (I 
don't know / remember / find out why, but if I recall correctly this was done to 
avoid the kernel to use it by default [also for ext3 partitions] causing kernel 
crashes), so it should be re-enabled in the gta02-defconfig and tested.</p>

permissions and the database files in my /data partition (which during the ext2 usage 
were often corrupted by forced reboots) and I noticed really a GREAT stability 
improvement.</p>

<p>So, maybe it's a kernel driver related issue, I don't know, but the ext2 (that I chosen not to stress my card) doesn't seem to perform as expected here.
This seems to be also the cause of the lockups I noticed sometimes when accessing to 
the /sdcard (which still uses an ext2 partition).</p>

<p>Talking about file systems... Few weeks ago phoronix posted a review/benchmark [1] 
where it was underlined that the ext4 file system was the best choice for usb flash 
devices; I don't know if this can be applied to a µSD card, but if it can, I figure 
that we could move to this FS to get better performances.
I've not tested this yet, since months ago the ext4 fs was disabled in OM kernels (I 
don't know / remember / find out why, but if I recall correctly this was done to 
avoid the kernel to use it by default [also for ext3 partitions] causing kernel 
crashes), so it should be re-enabled in the gta02-defconfig and tested.</p>

<p>In case that we have a problem with installer I suggest to supply SD based version of
subj prepared by manual procedure (
<a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Android_on_Freerunner">http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Android_on_Freerunner</a>). Find in attachment kernel
image, which is possible to use for creation SDversion of subj ( uImageSD.bin have
build from
current source tree, which have not include ram disk opposite normal kernel.img). 
 Here is a result:
<a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/343719214/android-on-freerunner-cupcake-0.2.0-RC1-SD.tar.gz.html">http://rapidshare.com/files/343719214/android-on-freerunner-cupcake-0.2.0-RC1-SD.tar.gz.html</a>
 I suggest to put it in download area.
 The subj should be extracted to second ( ext ) partition of
standart ( fat/ext ) prepared SD. It is better to have fat
part empty ( at least first time ). I suppose the qi was
installed, so no other step no need.
Only prepare SD and boot by pressing power button and
wait...
No changes in NAND will be done, subj is working only with
SD.
Good luck!!</p></markdown-widget>

Assume that you're starting with a regular build environment and the standard build has just been run. I assume you'd need to rebuild the kernel with a different .config, copy in a modified init.rc and do a few other things, then build an archive from the trees under out/target/product/freerunner/. If you can write a script that does that, we can integrate it into the build and produce SD and NAND installable versions routinely. </p></markdown-widget>

I have publish a way to create SD-based version some time. For example, here: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-on-freerunner/browse_thread/thread/d1c9dddb19a39a62/ef433e9f6329c136?lnk=gst&amp;q=mksdimage#ef433e9f6329c136">http://groups.google.com/group/android-on-freerunner/browse_thread/thread/d1c9dddb19a39a62/ef433e9f6329c136?lnk=gst&amp;q=mksdimage#ef433e9f6329c136</a>
Here is a double:
  1) Main problem for SD version is a special kernel build - see comment
11 of issue7.
    Kernel should be build from repository. Daily build has not this
special build.
    You have to create this special kernel build yourself!!!!
    In case that kernel change some rarely the version from comment 33
of issue7
    is possible use up to now (but not all time!!!)
2) The way to create SD version build from current daily build with
special kernal
    is decribed at  <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Android_on_Freerunner">http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Android_on_Freerunner</a>
and has been
    discussed at issue7.  I have try to create a small command script
to help you.
    May be it give you some idea.:</p>

<p>This script is good enouhg for cupcake. For ecliar and for froyo  simple sed editions:        sed -i -e"/ mount /s/ mount /# mount /
18i     mount rootfs rootfs / rw remount" init.rc
is not enough, more critical analyse of mount statments should be done. Do not forget that special kernel.img should be build </p></markdown-widget>

<p>Sorry for delay. I have to check current cupcake. I have not testing it, I am testing master(froyo) now. So I have only check that SD-based work for current repository of cupcake, but not cupcake itself.   But ~0,5 year of daily use of RC1 shows that SD-based cupcake work very well. I get reports of some gays about same result.
Find in attachment file1 - repo sync  to get SD-based out/target/product/freerunner</p>

<p>Good lack to see how it works out.</p></markdown-widget>

To avoid any misunderstending:
1) Script from comment 50 for guys, who does not work with repository and whoud like to get  SD-base tar.gz-image from ordinary tar.gz  image
2) To prepare SD-base tar.gz-image from repository's out/target/product/freerunner files structure use as example commands sequence shown in file2 of comment 51. This commands sequence is a part of script from comment 50, but more usefull. Fill free to convert this commands sequence to script for your working environment. I have one, but it close to my working environment.
3) Current ordinary tar.gz  image has empty userdata.img file , so I did not use it in my procedure. It possible to change it in future.
4) To create md5sum file use command:  md5sum file &gt; file.md5
Fill free contact me in any question.

<p>So you can create and SD-based image from the build tarballs provided by Serdar using the script in comments 50. Without the need of patching with file1 from comments 53.</p>

<p>Is my understanding correct?</p>

<p>Or do you still require the special prepared kernel as you call in the script using the patch from comments 53?</p>

  <p>Main problem for SD version is a special kernel build.
  Kernel should be build from repository. Serdar daily build has not this special build, so you have to create this special kernel build yourself!!!! 
      The kernel change some rarely, so the version of special kernel build from comment 33 is possible use up to now (but not all time!!!)</p>
  
  <p>And for those with a local repository, using file2 of comments 51 should work with the special kernel patch. Correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, only patched repository build create  out/target/product/freerunner structure, using which commands sequence from comments 51 does SDbased archive file.( Some sort of replace of installer. I have not success with installer build ) </p>

<p>I patched the files (patches from file in comment 53 - kernel config and init.rc), built it and copied to SD. The system boots and connects to GSM, GPRS and WiFi also work (copied old wpa_supplicant.conf), but I cannot get context menus when pressing power button quickly. The behaviour is the same as clicking AUX quickly - it jumps to previous screen. Does anyone know if this is some bug in SD version or if it is a general problem? pressing longer suspends the phone and pressing very long brings up menu for flight mode, etc - so this behaviour is correct.</p>

Main idea for froyo is same - special kernel build and some changes in init.rc. Changes in init.rc a bit differ then in cupcake's init.rc.
I have not chance to create repo diff at moment, but I have create some time ago a tar file with changes I have played with froyo, find it below.
Good luck.</p></markdown-widget>

I installed your versions of the files except for kernel (as the version changed).
For the kernel I used the old patch for not using initrd.</p>

<p>Only question I have is when you say we should be able to switch back and forth between the two branches without doing a make clean. How would this be done? When doing a repo init on a dedicated location in my system, don't you need to build the entire SD branch scratch? Or, you I already have a compiled cupcake/froyo branch, how do benefit from this (i.e. not recompiling everything again)?</p>

<p>Once I understand this a bit better, I can do the updates to the Wiki.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi, I am trying to install android on SD, it's really nice that a clear wiki page is now provided (and easy to find), thanks to all the authors.</p>

<p>I followed the guide (including patches from comment 70 in this thread) and built Froyo on my computer, found a small glitch during the building process, segmentation fault at page-writeback.c:820.</p>

<p>I "solved" it by commenting out line 918 in page-writeback.c:
// BUG_ON(PageWriteback(page));
as advised here <a href="http://www.idroidproject.org/forum/general-discussion/compiling-kernel-issues/">http://www.idroidproject.org/forum/general-discussion/compiling-kernel-issues/</a></p>

<p>Copied everything to SD card and tried to boot using U-Boot.
First issue is that U-Boot cannot boot from /boot directory on the same (Android system) partition, so I created another small (8MB) partition and put the kernel there (to make sure I actually put two identical copies, uImage.bin and uImage-GTA02.bin).
Then I created an entry in U-Boot and it seems to work, until it gets to the point where it mounts the root filesystem, shortly after the kernel goes into panic.</p>

<p>The last few messages before kernel panic are:
devtmpfs: mounted
Freeing init memory: 132K
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!</p>

<p>Can the problem be due to using U-Boot instead of Qi bootloader? I know there is an issue with U-Boot not being able to load images larger than 2MB (and Android is 2.1MB). I found in some other mailing list that this can be tweaked by setting this in U-Boot:
setenv bootcmd setenv bootargs \${bootargs_base} \${mtdparts}\; nand read.e 0x32000000 kernel 0x300000\; bootm 0x32000000</p>

<p>which I did but to no avail. If the problem is very likely due to U-Boot and can be solved by using Qi I don't mind switching to it. If instead the problem is elsewhere I rather keep U-Boot since I already have it setup for other distros.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. I know of NOR and how to access it, the problem is that it cannot be configured as far as I know, so you can only boot from one or two default partitions (i.e. can have one OS in NAND and one on first/second partition of SD). If I understand correctly Qi does not show a boot menu, instead it tries to boot from partitions on SD first and NAND then. Sure all this is not a problem after preparing the right SD/NAND combination and having optionally multiple SD cards.</p>

<p>I think I will have a try building and installing cupcake then, since I have no experience with android it would help having a more stable system. I can wait and try U-Boot first and then switch to Qi in case.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Build your own system and test out your changes.
In general the setup necessary to build Android-on-Freerunner is the same as for the main Android project. See the Get Android Source page there for instructions on downloading source code and setting up your machine's build environment. One important difference: The AoF-specific source code is hosted at our Gitorious repository, so to checkout AoF code use the following command (not the one on the source.android.com page): </p>

<p>$ repo init -u git://gitorious.org/android-on-freerunner/freerunner_platform_manifest.git -b froyoThe -b parameter on the repo command specifies the branch to check out, currently either cupcake or froyo. </p>

<p>thanks for your advise. I still got stuck again, maybe you can give me some more hints on what I'm missing. So here one step after the other what I did:
1) made new directory
~/Downloads/AndroidonSD/
2) got curl
~/Downloads/AndroidonSD/curl <a href="http://android.git.kernel.org/repo">http://android.git.kernel.org/repo</a> &gt; ./repo
3) created another directory
~/Downloads/AndroidonSD/cupcake
4) went into the cupcake directory and did
~/Downloads/AndroidonSD/cupcake $ ./../repo init -u git://gitorious.org/android-on-freerunner/freerunner_platform_manifest.git -b cupcake
5) download went fine. 
6) there were some question on my name and email which I regarded not of any influence for the installation
7) Downloaded the patch from issue 7 comment 70 into the cupcakedirectory: cupcake.patch (on the wiki page it says get the patches though it means get the relevant patch for your branch (either cupcake or froyo)
8) tried to apply the patch
~/Downloads/AndroidonSD/cupcake/patch -p1 &lt; cupcake.patch
ERROR:

<p>Just go your cupcake-sd dir and type:
repo sync </p>

<p>Then get yourself a cup of coffee, that's going to take a while.
This will get you the last sources (repo init just prepares the directory for the git repos...).</p>

<p>Now you are ready to compile cupcake-sd.</p>

<p>Have a lot of fun!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The error you have is not related to the SD branch or patches. It appears to me your build environment has not been configured correctly. I suggest we continue the discussion for getting your system configured correctly on the mailinglist.</p>

<p>Please post your message on the ML and we'll take it from there.</p>
