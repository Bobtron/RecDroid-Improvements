                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well in pure theory as soon as your 3G carrier prohibit to use VoIP on their data channel by contract it's theoretically not allowed. So I don't encourage you to break their controls because by contract they will always get the last world if it comes they decide to be annoying with you.</p>

<p>Personally I think these carrier are not very fair and users should push to refuse such contracts. 
Net neutrality is important and if they start blocking some usage it can goes in very bad ways and they can start blocking service they don't want you to use and finally totally handcuff their users to the service they choose.</p>

<p>So... some things you might find interesting :
These 3G carrier base their filtering usually on pretty simple things : the port used to connect the remote server and/or some deep packet inspection they do on what goes on the network (BTW, not very good for your privacy if they do so too).</p>

<p>If it's only a filtering on the port, changing the listening port of your pbx system will bypass such kind of check made on the network. 
If it's deep packet inspection, you then need to encrypt stuff. 
BTW, if they do deep packet inspection, I do recommend you to always use encryption to connect internet service (even for http, use https, for mail use imaps/pop+tls)... who knows what they could do with your packets if they start listening and inspecting everything on their network.
So to encrypt SIP, there is SIPS (sip+tls). It's the equivalent of https for http. It usually run on port 5061 and everything transmitted is encrypted and it's impossible for somebody in the middle to tell what is transmitted. You will also need to encrypt audio if you want to be 100% safe. To do so you can use SRTP or ZRTP (zrtp is the more recent and promising one).
Else, you can of course use the big hammer which is VPN. The disavantage of VPN is that the channel is always connected and active and it might drain battery faster. The advantage (if configured to do so) is that it will encrypt everything and your carrier will not see anything more than one connection to your vpn server (but you can fear they detect you use only one channel and use vpn ;) ).</p>

<p>If it's your own pbx system (whatever if you decide or not to overcome your operator restriction and potentially break the contract), I advise you to have a look on the TLS solution. It's good to encrypt sip even if you use wifi access point.</p></markdown-widget>

You may need to set up a different port (and I'd suggest not using one close to these numbers). Changing the port for unencrypted SIP seemed to work for me, but I then had trouble with one-way audio...</p>

<p>I also found trying to configure SIPS and encrypted RTP a right pain in the @$$ and never got it to work, but got both StrongSWAN and PPTP VPNs working - so configured CSipSimple on that handset to use the RFC1918 address of my localnet VoIP server thus only reachable on my home WiFi or via the VPN.</p></markdown-widget>
