<p>Connection to my 3CX PhoneServer via WiFi (local connection) and 3G,HSPDA,GPRS,... so to configure my mobile as an internal/external extension on my 3CX PhoneServer.</p>

<p>Testing both the two profiles an echo at remote-party can be heard. Also tryng to call an internal extension on my 3CX I experienced the same behaviour.</p>

<p>I tried also to change the echo queue from 200 to an higher value of 300 and 400 but with no success.</p>

<p>Anyway, let me say that you are doing a great job and my opinion is that your project can be figure out as one of the best sip client available on android market up today. If possible I'd like to join your project. </p>

I recently fix something on galaxy S (i9000), it was exactly the same problem. 
You can try to download and use the version -13-02 available on the download section. <em>Remove the market version before installing this one</em>.</p>

<p>-13-02 fix things for samsung i9000. However you'll not be able to reduce the volume with volume key, but can be performed using Preference &gt; media &gt; speaker amplification (set to lower than 1).
Galaxy S owners, before I fixed the speaker issue usually set it to 0.2 to remove echo. I don't know now with my last fix what is a good value. 
But if it fixes it for you too and avoid to output on rear-speaker it will significantly delete echo. Rear-speaker usually spread the sound through the whole phone, and so the micro record output.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, so probably an issue with what is done by samsung on this device.
I think, it's exactly the same problem that the one present on 5700 solved by samdroid on his custom rom :
<a href="http://forum.samdroid.net/f9/sipdroid-voip-i5700-problems-983/">http://forum.samdroid.net/f9/sipdroid-voip-i5700-problems-983/</a></p>

<p>Could make sense, 5500 and 5700 are probably two devices based on some common hardware/ driver implementation. Solution on 5700 is to install the custom rom...But AFAIK there is no custom rom with this fix on 5500.</p>

<p>The only thing we can hope is that there is a workaround. You can maybe try to pickup randomly some of my builds. I did many tests on the audio routing stuff between 0.00-12-02 and 0.00-12-29.</p>

<p>You could for example try : -07 that is really interesting since there is an option in settings&gt;media to choose the exact audio mode you want to use. MODE_IN_CALL, MODE_NORMAL are interesting to test usually.
-10, -19, -25 could be interesting too (the audio mode is hard coded in these versions but flow on audio setup can differ).</p>

<p>If you are going on an older version you'll need to uninstall the app. (Maybe between each test even if an upgrade... but I'm not sure it's necessary for an upgrade).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I think that the echo problem on samsung device could be generated by more then one single root cause. Since echo at calling party varies in terms on volume and delay I think that automatic gain control working feature (samsung microphone) could be to investigate more in detail. </p>

<p>Hope this could help

<p>In this case the only thing we could do is wait for samsung to fix the issue or wait for a custom ROM (such as samdroid one to fix it).</p>

<p>However I'll try to see if there is nothing I can do improving the echo canceller but as here the problem is that recording actually record the played track, I don't think that the pjsip echo canceller is designed to solve this kind of problem but more to solve it when what is re-recorded is delayed and louder than what is emmited. I've to investigate how the pjsip echo canceller works, but I've not much hope on this side.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Could you try to install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-15-16.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-15-16.apk</a> .</p>

<p>It include 3 hidden settings. To activate it :
Go in Settings &gt; press menu and switch to "Expert mode".
Then in Settings &gt; Media scroll to the bottom.
The 3 settings are :
Use Routing API =&gt; It enforce to use the old API that is deprecated in android 2.0. Some ROM however are based on old audio drivers but are &gt; to 2.0. In this case activating this setting can help
Use Mode API =&gt; It enforce to use something that is actually not an API but that is considered by some manufacturer to be the way to route audio... It's a very bad idea to use that on some device cause it use mode_in_call that directly plug GSM chipset to audio hardware. But sometimes on some devices that's the only way to get routing goes through earpiece.
In Call Mode =&gt; (Useless if you use "Mode API"), Force to use one audio mode. On most device should be set to Normal. But sometimes could be interesting to test others.</p>

<p>Echo is maybe due to some routing problem with the micro + earpiece/speaker so worth to try.
Thanks</p></markdown-widget>

issue.</p>

<p>I installed the new build as per your request and set the following:
- Use routing API -&gt; enable
- Use Mode audio API -&gt; enable
- Audio mode for SIP calls -&gt; Normal (first) / MANUFACTURER_EXTRA (2nd try)</p>

<p>I got an excellent improvement using WiFI connection (the ones more affected 
by echo at called party)
By using (Audio mode set to NORMAL) the echo is still audible even if quite 
far. Using MANUFACTORER_EXTRA it seems to be no echo at all.</p>

<p>After that let me give to you some more details on my GT-I5500 samsung 
mobile europen/italian version, so if someone match the following the above 
settings can solve definitively the problem also when there is no official 
possibility to upgrade the firmware due to branded devices.</p>

<ul>
<li>The firmware installed is:</li>
<li>PDA / PHONE / CSC version JH1</li>
<li>Android 2.1 update1 Build ERE27</li>
</ul>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Extremely strange :</p>

<p>If you enable "Mode audio API" the "audio mode" setting is not taken into account. So I guess that you were just more lucky the second try.
Actually here are interesting combination that you could try :</p>

<hr>

<p>Routing API = on
Mode API = off</p>

<h2>Audio Mode = NORMAL</h2>

<p>Routing API = off
Mode API = on</p>

<h2>Audio Mode = (not relevant since "mode api" is enabled)</h2>

<p>Routing API = off
Mode API = off</p>

<h2>Audio Mode = IN_CALL</h2>

<p>Routing API = on
Mode API = off
Audio Mode = IN_CALL
--- (the default configuration)
Routing API = off
Mode API = off
Mode = NORMAL</p>

<p>Actually mode MANUFACTURER_EXTRA is not allowed on most devices (if actually used - mode audio api disabled- I think that you'll get nothing at all, or a crash, or it will silently fallback to NORMAL). 
That's a private API for only one manufacturer that contact me directly and that has created a special and optimized mode for VoIP.</p>

<p>If you can just quickly test these settings and say me which is the best (try also to activate/deactivate rear-speaker to see if it correctly switch in each case).</p>

<p>But well sounds to be a really good news. (I think what actually solve the problem on your phone is the "Mode audio API" not sure that routing API is really needed).</p>

<p>So, to integrate the default settings to the source code I'll need some constant defined in the phone. 
You can't get that from the android interface, but in development version there is an easy way to send me this information : Go in Help &gt; Press record logs. Then go in help again and press stop log recording &amp; send logs. Then you should be prompted to send trace by mail. (In these traces I put the exact device name as defined in the android system could be different of the "commercial" name)</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for testing that</p></markdown-widget>
