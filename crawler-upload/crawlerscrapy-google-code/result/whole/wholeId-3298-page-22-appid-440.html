It may also affect the micro in use.
Samsung does really crappy things with their audio layer. Each device needs its own workaround and sometimes it could give headache to get something that is working. And they sometimes mess themselves with the mode and the micro source (and sometimes also with the frequency ).</p>

<p>The fact that you can't modify volume as stated in issue 1476 is also probably linked to the audio mode for sip calls or another routing option. However, not sure that other audio mode will allow you to choose route between speaker and earpiece.
Theorical normal settings for a clean implementation of android 2.3 is to have sip mode to COMMUNICATION and micro to COMMUNICATION. It's what's used by the stock android sip application. However, many manufacturers postponed the support of sip on their devices and didn't paid attention to do things cleanly on their audio stack.</p>

<p>Without the device on my hands it's hard to tell what are the correct options for this device.</p>

<p>If you find something that works the best, feel free to tell me, and I'll integrate as default setting for this device. (I will also need some logs to be able to know the exact device code name).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>the logs collected are as follows</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Based on the GPL CSipSimple version : 0.04-00 r1235
Here are important informations about Device : 
android.os.Build.BOARD : SGH-I997
android.os.Build.BRAND : samsung
android.os.Build.DEVICE : SGH-I997
android.os.Build.ID : GINGERBREAD
android.os.Build.MODEL : SAMSUNG-SGH-I997
android.os.Build.PRODUCT : SGH-I997
android.os.Build.TAGS : release-keys
android.os.Build.VERSION.INCREMENTAL : UCKL2
android.os.Build.VERSION.RELEASE : 2.3.6
android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK : 10</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>I have tried a couple of different settings, tested on Pennytel sip server (supports g711A, g711U and g729) and found the following settings work almost perfectly for me on a 3G network (Telstra NextG, HSPA+, latency about 100ms - 160ms in my area):</p>

<p>microphone source: VOICE_CALL (others work too)
sip mode: IN_CALL (resulted in CORRECT mic being used)
Audio implementation: openSL-ES
codec: G711 resulted in less latency than G729 (less CPU processing?)
speaker amplification: 2.5
microphone amplification: 10.0 (wish to have the default increased by 10 times as I have to talk much louder for the other end to hear me well);</p>

<p>Please note that during a sip call, the in-call volume keys on this phone did not work directly but can be used  by first pressing menu/media keys that brought up the volume and microphone amplification. However, pressing the keys only adjusted the volume amplification.</p>

<p>Last night I tested with Viber loaded at the same time with CSIPSIMPLE and surprisedly found that the wrong mic was used by CSIPSIMPLE! When I stopped Viber, CSIPSIMPLE picked the correct mic again. Skype did not cause the issue as Viber did.</p>

<p>That's all for the update. Please let me know if you need further information.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p></markdown-widget>
