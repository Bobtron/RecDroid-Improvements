                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Install the Google Voice app and configure it with your GV number.
2. Set the GV app to prompt the user on each dial whether or not to use GV.
3. Set cSIPSimple to integrate with the dialer.
4. Select a contact to call, or dial a number from the dialer.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>The result is that you're first prompted with the GV integration. Whether you choose to use GV or not, it then passes to the cSIPSimple integration, which prompts you to choose between SIP and GSM. Selecting either one of these returns you to the GV prompt, and you keep looping between the two. In short, you can never complete your call.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>Motorola Droid, Android 2.2, latest Google Voice.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I don't really know how google voice manage outgoing calls.</p>

<p>Just something you can try and that will help me :
Go to CSipSimple, Menu &gt; Option &gt; User interface and uncheck the Activate integration box. Then retry to place a call using the native dialer. Say me if GV dialer loop alone or if you can place a call.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>1) Enable GV to "ask each time I call" and enable active integration on cSIPSimple -- loops between GV selector and cSIPSimple selector infinitely until you select SIP. Can't place non-SIP call.</p>

<p>2) Disable cSIPSimple active integration -- GV selector works as intended.</p>

<p>3) Enable cSIPSimple active integration and set GV integration to "always use GV" (no prompt from GV) -- loops through cSIPSimple prompt infinitely until selecting SIP. Can't place non-SIP call.</p>

<p>4) Disable GV integration entirely, enable cSIPSimple integration -- cSIPSimple integration works as expected, but GV does not.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

I'm new to Android dev and taking baby steps with CSipSimple to help Regis. This one sounds like something I can dig into. I'm assuming that (3) above allows placing a SIP call (only)? Basically CSipSimple needs to activate the mobile dialer or its own SIP service in a way that doesn't allow the GV filter/selector to operate AGAIN.</p>

<p>So Regis, did you maybe fix this already? I just want to know before I spend time learning what I need to attack the problem.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I think that there is surely something to do inside .service.OutgoingCall to prevent the next ask to the currently dialed number to be handled by csipsimple chooser.
That's already the way it prevent looping with other sip dialers such as sipdroid one for example.
What is possible is that GV add something to the phone number that make it different between the first call of OutgoingCall and the second one made after the GV popup.</p>

<p>If you can try to debug this point it's cool. It's hard to me to create a GV account (since not available with french google accounts).</p>

<p>P.S. : Really happy to see at my wake-up that there where a lot of activity :) Great job!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I am not seeing an infinite loop between the two dialers. The same sequence occurs when selecting "with GV" or "without GV" in either or both steps 1 and 3, it always results in the mobile call being placed in step 4.</p>

<p>If in step 2 (CSipSimple) you select one of the SIP accounts, the call is immediately placed via SIP. In this case, the behavior is already acceptable. The only design choice is which of the two selectors should appear first. My feeling is that CSipSimple should be the first to appear :-) but this may not be possible due to not having control over GV's intent priority.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Did you try the &lt;&gt; Use Case?</p>

<p>The double ask from GV is "normal" since GV don't make the check that I implemented (and that is also done by sipdroid for example... they don't use the same way but the result is quietly the same).</p>

<p>In fact, sipdroid and csipsimple catch the "tel:" intent. If the tel number is unknown, (and under other network conditions), they propose the user what to do with the call. When they propose something to the user, the intent is cleared and no other application will be notified of this ongoing intent.
If you choose GSM, a new intent will be done. By the way, the app will be notified once again that a tel: intent is launched.
CSipsimple will be notified of this, but as it remember that the user has just asked to use GSM for this call, it will not catch the intent and let other application to handle this intent.</p>

<p>It appears that GV doesn't act the same way. They probably don't take care of this issue and use private apis. 
But unfortunately nothing can be done to solve this issue without modifying GV. Unless there is way to : 
* directly call gsm instead of publishing a new "tel:" intent
* stop the intent propagation while asking the user what to do with this intent instead of cancelling the intent.</p></markdown-widget>

One problem is that there seems to be no way get in front of Google Voice. I wanted to have CSip's call selector to appear before Google Voice, and only if you choose Mobile, then Google Voice's selector appears. I played with several approaches, and put the priority of CSip's receiver even at 99999 and GV still gets control first, and again when you start a new cycle. I'm right back where I started :-( but I have learned a lot about how the OS manages things!!</p>

<p>I did try that, and there is no problem. Choosing Mobile results in a Google Voice mobile call, and choosing a CSip account results in a SIP call. Only with the "ask" option is there trouble.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>In CSipSimple, set the integration to "Integrate privileged intent" under the User Interface options.
In Google Voice, set the dialing preference to "Use GV to make all calls."</p>

<p>Attempting to make a call in the stock dialer brings up the familiar "app selection" choice.  If you select CSipSimple, it still brings up the "SIP Call" selection dialog.  Here selecting "Use mobile" goes right through for me.  Likewise, selecting IP works great.</p>

<p>Though, with this setup you will always be presented with the choice (if wifi is available at least).  I think this depends on your account settings within CSipSimple.</p>
