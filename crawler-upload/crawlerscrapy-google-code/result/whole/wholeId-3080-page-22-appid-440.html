<p>I've already validated that it works for x86 out of box. I hope that it will go the same on mips.</p>

<p>So the only remaining step is to automate the build. I can basically do some private build for that purpose but I think it will be better if my nightly build server do that automatically :)</p></markdown-widget>

Well, the mips ndk produce a lot of warning but finally it builds correctly CSipSimple without many efforts (I just had to take that into account in ffmpeg build and to do a very small modification in webRTC).</p>

<p>So, if you have time, can you test :
<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/specific_builds/CSipSimple-Mips.apk">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/specific_builds/CSipSimple-Mips.apk</a></p>

<p>Since I've no device to test on, it's just a theoretical build. I encountered some issues with x86 in release mode, so if this one doesn't work there is still chance it works using debug mode.</p>

<p>If we reach something working, I will be able to take MIPS arch easily into a daily build process as I should also do for x86.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for the test</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Actually the place where you look at is a placeholder for presence sharing. And it doesn't take yet into account the registration state. The place where you can actually see registration is in account list. But I guess it's in yellow state 'inactive'. There is probably something not working with my build.
Can you collect logs (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/HowToCollectLogs?wl=en">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/HowToCollectLogs?wl=en</a> ).
So that I can have an idea of where it fails loading the lib.</p>

<p>I guess there is multiple users following here. Keep in mind that the only build that is interesting is the one with Mips in its name. Those of nightly builds will not work since it's for armeabi target (unless you do your own builds, but if so tell it to me in your logs).</p>

<p>Well some status of what I can see :
 - 2 out of 3 logs concerning novo7paladin are made using a build I didn't provide for mips (either some private build done or the nightly build of server, but this one is not intended to work on mips). These fails with a ENOTTY error. But if it's builds from nightlies it's obvious failure (since the FIONBIO constant changes between mips and arm target); if it's your own builds but works on your device it would mean that the ROM used on this device is higher and can support better the latest mips NDK.
 - 1 of the logs (from Oleg) appears to use my private build and fails with a loading error. This fails with a 
"Cannot load library: mips_relocate_got[1804]:    81 In 'libpjsipjni.so', can't locate symbol __udivdi3"
This is weird because the NDK of mips seems to contains this symbol in libc.a.</p></markdown-widget>

BTW, sounds the magic code works better than mips ndk because in this case, I think that I know what to change in the arm build to get things working (the FIONBIO constant has not the same value and I'm almost sure that if I do a arm build by hard coding the FIONBIO to the value of mips ndk, it will work).</p>

<p>Then the problem with the private build seems to be this __udivdi3. My fear is that it tries to load this .so using the "magic code". I wonder that because __udivdi3 is a symbol that doesn't exists on arm but exists on mips (regarding the mips ndk), and because the logs shows "mips_relocate_got" which sounds to me something from a magic code trying to relocate arm symbols into mips ones.
So, I'm wondering if there is not also something with the SDK. I've just noticed mips also provide a diverted sdk, that will allow me to test using emulator :D
Maybe it also flag the app so that the mips device try to load .so files as mips arch ones. (normally it should use the folder name in the apk, but maybe they do something different).</p></markdown-widget>

But it's slightly identical to previous.</p>

<p>I saw from other users logs that your version is probably a little bit outdated. I see that it's a
android.os.Build.VERSION.INCREMENTAL : 808
android.os.Build.VERSION.RELEASE : 4.0.3</p>

<p>While other users have</p>

<p>android.os.Build.VERSION.INCREMENTAL : 1975
android.os.Build.VERSION.RELEASE : 4.0.3
and 
android.os.Build.VERSION.INCREMENTAL : 1113
android.os.Build.VERSION.RELEASE : 4.0.3</p>

<p>So I was wondering if could not be something with version.
Or maybe it could be something with cache on the device. Try to first uninstall csipsimple, reboot and install the mips version. (Maybe the app keep cache info on which app needs magic code and keep trying applying it to csipsimple).</p></markdown-widget>

Tried this new build - there is no difference. I see the same "Cannot load library" record in log. I tried to uninstall both csipsimple and magic code, then reboot, then install csipsimple. I saw post on Russian forum from another guy who tried this build on slightly different MIPS-based device (Ainol Novo7 Basic) with the same result as myself. I'll ask him to send you log from his device.
BTW when I install this build it proposes to update to the newest nightly build. I suspect that it would download latest ARM build and override MIPS build. That might explain people testing ARM build on MIPS devices.</p></markdown-widget>

SipDroid for example is almost pure java project and have very few native stuff. CSipSimple is almost all done of native stuff (for performance purpose and because the underlying sip stack is native).</p>

<p>Besides, even for native project they could not be impacted as well. The problem seems to be some optimization added by gcc (with __udivdi3) for some kind of divisions. Not all projects contains this kind of situation and so, not everything build with the NDK may be impacted. But for pjsip, it's the case because there is many place where this optimization could apply.
So I'm trying to dive into the mips gcc to see how (if possible) to disable this optimisation introduced by this gcc.
The very amazing thing is that this optim symbol seems to be built in the NDK (it appears in the libc.a). </p></markdown-widget>

<p>I trust more in this one (at least about the __udivdi3 fix). </p>

<p>I did some hard fix in the Mips NDK to workaround what appears to me either a NDK bug or a miss on the distributed android ROM that doesn't conform the NDK requirements. (I think more about the second option since the emulator doesn't has the problem).</p>

<p>If you can test it and tell me how it goes; Also in case of failure, I will be very interested in logs you could collect. I've hard included one core library to have it working, but I could still miss another one (since errors are raised one by one).</p>

<hr>

<p>For the more technical part of how I workaround that in case it works and interest anybody else :
since udivdi3 seems not present on the real device, and is part of libgcc, I just included libgcc as a static library dependency of the project (which means adding a new prebuilt target in the mk files and referencing this target as static_lib of each .so you build).
This is workaround should only apply to this mips arch/device, since it's the very first time a device is encountered without respecting what is provided by the ndk as libgcc library. So care to make this dependency only active when arch is mips and not in other cases (or your builds will be unnecessarily bigger).</p></markdown-widget>

The audio works in your case? I often have doubts with new devices because the manufacturers doesn't always respect android api for voip calls routing.</p>

<p>About nightly builds, yes, the workaround can be added in source code without impacting other versions.
I still need to complete other steps for this to land however. For example I have to understand why I still get some crash in release mode for x86 builds. I also need to add a real channel for these builds (to have automatic updates). And finally to modify builds scripts :). But that's on the road.</p>

There were some problems though. I was able to call csipsimple-&gt;skype (through skype.sipnet.ru) but skype-&gt;csipsimple didn't work for some reason. 
Also app "stopped" when I tried to add phone number I called to contact list. I don't have any contact list app installed, so no surprize here ;)
I can send you log from this build if you want.</p></markdown-widget>
