I didn't know that android 2.1 has ipv6 support so I didn't build it with IPv6 support.</p>

<p>As the native stack support it (<a href="http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/IPv6">http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/wiki/IPv6</a>), not so dev effort to make it available on CSipSimple. Only a precompilation variable to change I guess.
I can try to turn it on in next version.
The biggest deal is to see if it doesn't increase too much the native lib size. </p>

<p>For example for TLS support, I will have to release an alternate native library since it make the size of the lib twice bigger than the normal one.
But my distribution mode quietly already allow this kind of diverts for the native library source. So CSipSimple is already designed to do that kind of extra support.</p>

<p>So if you have a way to test ipv6 support I'll try to build next version with ipv6 so that you can test it.</p></markdown-widget>

Socket transportation, methods of getting IP addresses .etc in IPV6 are different from that in IPV4. So not only the precompilation of pjsip stack for IPV6 support, extra effort on CSipSimple are also needed, I guess. But I think it worth that, since IPV6 is a trend in the future.
I got a sip server built on OpenSips supporting both IPV6 and IPV4, so I can test the IPV6 support of CSipSimple.</p></markdown-widget>

That's the advantage of relying on a full featured sip stack :). The only thing CSipSimple do is using &amp; configuring the UserAgent provided by the native library. Then everything is done on the native library. (That's the reason why we get good perfs results).</p>

<p>I've just done a build with ipv6 enabled, there is not a so big extra size, so could be included in main version.</p>

<p>I've already done the switch to create the good transport type (checkbox added in preferences - I guess that's useless to enable both ipv6 and ipv4 at the same time...). That's quietly easy to do... 
Now hardest part, I have to do the media transport creation. That's differ in ipv6 according to the pjsua_app sample. But it doesn't look so complicated.</p></markdown-widget>

I am working on an Windows based sip client, and we have built our own SIP server with about 20 thousand people registered on it. But a sip on a mobile phone seems more interesting. If lator versions of CSipSimple can support instant message and vedio communication, integration with phone contact, that would be so perfect!!</p></markdown-widget>

For video... well there is much more things to do. As my approach is to relie as much as possible on the more abstract layer of pjsip it would be difficult to add video support quickly as pjsip ua doesn't support it. However this last feature is more wanted by users ... and even if I think it's just a gadget it usually make the buzz around the app. So I'm wondering if I'll put my efforts on video before IM (since IM requires many user interface in the java app while video is only one simple view). 
Well I've not yet choose between the two... but that's in the future... For now many other things to do to support properly voice :). 
However... that's an opensource/libre project, and if anyone want to contribute he will be welcome !!! I can only talk for my roadmap but if other developers (or sip providers that want to become partners of the opensource project) are interested by developing specific features it will be available for all users ;).</p></markdown-widget>

For now a good idea could be to disable DNS SRV option in order to be sure there is no problem due to DNS SRV engine.
I'm not really confident in the patch, so if it doesn't work, could you send me logs (see HowToCollectLogs on wiki)</p></markdown-widget>

First issue with listen address is solved. (I missed a flag in my pjsip port to allow inet resolution for ipv6). Now on my labs it well announce to be listening to the current ipv6 address. 
Now I have to understand why it fails to create the contact header field with an ipv6 addr. Sounds brackets [] are required in the header field... but if I hard code things in pjsip then ipv6 transport is not found back... </p>

<p>I fear that's not linked to android however, there is maybe something strange in pjsip with the way they handle ipv6 address and transport in pjsua (user agent stack). I have to do the same of a PC version to check if there is not another missing flag in my build.
But well, it progresses all the more so as I've a lab to test ipv6 now.</p></markdown-widget>

Yeah, [] are required around the IPV6 addresses, at least in our project. The contact field looks like:</p>

<p>Contact: </p>

<p>It needs [] to distinguish ":" in IPV6 address and ":" before port number. The sip stack of our project is Resiprocate.
Hope that will help:-)</p></markdown-widget>

Should now listen properly on the good port.
However it will probably not register as it is still not well formatting the contact field... I have to dive more deeper in pjsip code on this point. I though it was functional on pjsip but even if I provide to the stack good infos it doesn't work...</p>

<p>I have also to find a sip server available on my ipv6 network ... since I've just found out that the sip server on which I was trying to register had no ipv6 address ! That's a shame cause it's the one of my internet provider which also provide me a ipv6 address! They provide an ipv6 address to each of their users (if they want to)... but their sip server has no sip server... lol...</p></markdown-widget>
