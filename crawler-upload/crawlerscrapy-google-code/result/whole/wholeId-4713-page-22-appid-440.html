And that means, pjsip is looking for openssl header+libs. openssl is present on Android, but I am not sure how to build &amp; link against this provided version. In worst case you would have to provide your own copy of openssl. But I didn't dig very deep into this. So I am not sure if this would be necessary or not. You know probably better.</p>

<p>Furthermore, once you have pjsip with TLS capabilities (and exposed a config option to the GUI), we can also enable SRTP (media encryption). That would be a fantastic match!</p>

<p>TLS(SIP) + SRTP is something many people are looking for. "Vendors" like Snom, Aastra, Counterpath, etc. have implemented this already. Would be great to see it on csipsimple too.</p>

<p>How about settings :
First of all, you should activate TLS.
  Settings &gt; Network &gt; Secure transport -&gt; Enable TLS (and also maybe SRTP could be a good idea)</p>

<p>Then configure your TLS account :
  Account &gt; Add &gt; Expert (you can start by a Basic and then transform it into an Expert)</p>

<p>Registrar URI + proxy URI : you should probably put something with sips (<em>s</em>) protocol, it will automatically choose 5061 as remote port, which should be the default on your server.
  In transport you must choose TLS.
  If you want secure media for SRTP mode choose optional or mandatory.</p>

<p>And everything then should be fine :).</p>

<p>Registers and calls will be done using TLS. Media will try/force (optional/mandatory) use of SRTP.</p>

<p>I've not yet tested other TLS method that TLSv1 (I mean not SSLv*), nor played with sips:xxx to make calls (the UI doesn't permit that).</p>

<p>But at least for TLS seems to work fine right now.</p></markdown-widget>

The only thing that remains is the default port : 5061 (like 443 for https) but can be changed.
Then to encrypt totally (not only sip exchange but also media exchange), you can also use SRTP (or soon thanks to Werner's contribution, ZRTP).</p>

I<code>m trying to start CSipSimple-r419-tls.apk on HTC Wildfire. Client is registered, when using UDP, but not when switching on TLS.
Server doesn</code>t receive any packet, in log CSipSimple I found the following:

When using TLS/RTP everything is OK, but when switching SRTP to mandatory hangup happens at once, log is attached.</p>

<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a></p>

<p>Now TLS and ZRTP are part of trunk builds. ZRTP support should have been really improved.</p>

<p>As it's a new build toolchain and it's based on a different pjsip version there is maybe some possible regression, feel free to open new issues about it :). Also I'm unsure about how it will go on all android phones since the openssl library is not included into the app but it tries to rely on the one of the phone. 
For now I never found a phone without openssl on it. However, if someone has a phone without openssl I can produce a plugin which intent to provide openssl library to CSipSimple.  </p>

<p>When this version will become stable, it will be released on android market so that android market version will also have secure features :)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I know that's very bad user experience to have to enable manually the transport while you already configured the transport to be TLS in expert wizard. But I want to leave the expert wizard to be a raw access to the sip stack configuration without doing extra conf. 
What is planned is to warn about the fact there is something not coherent when one set an account transport to TLS while the transport is not enabled in global settings. But since this is only for expert users for now, that's not something with high priority ;).</p>

<p>BTW, other wizards that use a known sip provider that has TLS support do that automatically. (for now there's just tanstagi ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>

I am using nightly build 0.04-00r1250 and trying to set up a TSL + SRTP call using a test server Asterisk, when CSipSimple tries to register to the server it uses TSL as required and everything is OK, but when I want to make a call it keeps using SIP over UDP but not TSL which I can tell by taking a capture on the server computer. On the other hand I have another CSipSimple client at the otherside which has also TSL+SRTP enabled receiving the call, the SIP messages between called party and server transported on TSL. To sum up, CSipSimple as caller uses SIP/UDP and as callee uses TSL. Is there something I am missing? 
Thank you,</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Normally, the good solution to this case would be to have cispsimple supporting "sips:" scheme in text edit mode (and automatically add it when dialing using an account that is a tls account). That's the point of another issue (see issue 1545).</p>

<p>But the simplier way for you for now is just to configure your sip server as the proxy for sip calls (btw, it's pretty standard config ;) -- the basic wizard configure both registrar and proxy when you enter server name).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>However, normally you can also use the "TLS CA file" field to specify a TLS CA list file.
You can have a look here for exact mean of each field.

<p>Normally it requires absolute file path. The best way is probably to put on sdcard. I never tried however. CSipSimple entirely rely on pjsip for that, so if it doesn't work probably some problem in pjsip ;).</p>

<p>I'm using freeswitch as well.  I can get two csipsimple endpoints to register and signal using TLS (sslv23) but can't get incoming calls on either of them from either of them.  Did you install client certs?  How did you get the two endpoints to communicate (receive incoming calls form each other?)</p>

<p>Maybe there is some interesting clue when the call is incoming in CSipSimple logs. I had some problems on a ICS 4.0 with TCP on one (only one carrier) 3G network (broken pipe). I'm investigating that, but sounds a bug in the ICS ROM I'm using. Maybe I'm wrong and it's something more global with recent changes of pjsip library. So your logs could be valuable to determine root cause problem.</p></markdown-widget>

It's not yet made automatically by the app but to have a TLS account you need 2 settings enabled :
1- is the global TLS transport that must be activated. It can be done in settings &gt; network &gt; secure transport. Here check the TLS transport. This will allow the SIP stack to use a TLS transport if necessary for one account.
2- it the account setting. Each account can define which transport it should use. This setting is at account level. To enable TLS for an account, transform the account to "expert" wizard (if was not already the case) by long pressing account row and choose wizard. Then, select TLS in transport.
I advise you to not start from "expert" wizard directly as a mistake in this wizard can be done quickly. It's better to start from basic wizard and after to long press &gt;choose wizard to transform it into expert one and just modify the transport option.</p></markdown-widget>

Basically settings you see here are settings from pjsip.
You can get more details here :
<a href="http://www.pjsip.org/docs/2.0-alpha2/pjsip/docs/html/structpjsip__tls__setting.htm">http://www.pjsip.org/docs/2.0-alpha2/pjsip/docs/html/structpjsip__tls__setting.htm</a>

(I suspect a typo for TLSv1).</p>

<p>But seems it doesn't support TLSv1.1 and v1.2. 
I'm also not sure the build we use as linking base includes v1.1 and v1.2 and even less sure that android openssl builds also includes tlsv1.1 and tlsv1.2.
If both already support it's probably not too hard to patch pjsip to add the feature. Else, it means the need to add these method to the builds too (and probably to hack to get it bundled inside csipsimple instead of relying on system crypto binaries).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As for TLS validation, I figured out a work around documented on my team's issue tracker[1]</p>

<p>The standard SIP TLS implementations (pjsip, kamailio, etc) in C have an option for server certificate validation to a root CA using a single file encoded in PEM format and stored on the local filesystem. This file stores all common root CA certificates. Since CSipSimple uses a C library for this functionality, the shortest development path is to implement those C functions in Java with the default parameters. This means the Android system certificates are bypassed.</p>

<p>So, if you download this file[2] to your device's SD card and enter in the full path in the CSipSimple configuration for CA certificates, validation will work as expected. This file was created with the contents of a Debian package[3] named ca-certificates. It is a concatenated list of every file that package writes to /etc/ssl/certs/</p>

<p>Obviously, this does not scale. A possible solution would be to create a plugin APK (like the codec pack) for CSipSimple that performs this concatenation and sends the file to app local storage, though having the CA Certificates in r/w storage creates a new security issue. Perhaps this plugin could also manage a revocation list and perform some kind of periodic update from upstream.</p>
