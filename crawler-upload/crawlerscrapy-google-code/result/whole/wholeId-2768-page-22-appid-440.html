                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>It's not exactly the status.</p>

<p>Using FEC, as stated by the jira issue description, requires the media stack to be designed to allow the coder/decoder to access the jitter buffer. It's not the case in pjmedia for now (even if jitter buffer already exists). 
So using FEC for <em>decoding</em> and retrieving packets is not possible in current implementation.
<em>However</em>, PLC (packet loss concealment) feature of SILK <em>IS</em> used. This method use previous packets decoded and is more about to deduce audio from previous frames by extrapolation. While FEC get information contained in next frames to deduce current frame.</p>

<p>So there is PLC, no FEC in the decoder implementation. Which is already not too bad.</p>

<p>FEC is not yet support and is not relevant of CSipSimple project anymore. SILK codec has been integrated in main pjsip project and will make sense to have this done at pjsip side (all the more so as in present case, will require modifications of pjmedia to get jitter buffer).</p>

<p>Now, about how it inter-operates with something that does support FEC...
When the codecs are negociated there is a fmtp sent by remote side. Whatever it's an incoming or an outgoing call. It's just in the remote SDP.
This parameter is there to tell us if the remote side does or doesn't support FEC. (On our side when we send an SDP we tell the remote side that we do not support it).
Then, 
 * What we do if the remote side announce to not support FEC ?
- We tell silk to not enclose FEC information in <em>Encoded</em> packects. Packets will be smaller and we will save bandwidth as anyway the remote side will not use it. 
 * What we do if remote side tells it supports FEC?
- We tell silk to add FEC information to packets we encode. So remote side will be able to use FEC information if it does support it.</p>

<p>So to sum up :
 * Using FEC information is not supported (whatever it's incoming/outgoing call). 
 * PLC is supported. 
 * FEC support is to be done in pjsip and requires pjmedia to be modified.
 * If remote side supports using FEC information we will send it in packets
 * No need to add option for that as we should conform what's asked by remote side.</p></markdown-widget>

When you send to remote side you should take into account this parameter and provide it to SILK encoder.</p>

<p>But, indeed there is a second parameter about that I completely forgot. It's the packetLossPercent. This one has no dedicated SDP parameter but is indeed used by SILK encoder to know if it should or not send LLBR info (FEC info) in packets.</p>

<p>As far as I understood from SILK doc, the useinbandfec value is something set by remote side to you using the SDP. the packetLossPercent is something that you are responsible to set. 
Naive implementation would be to try to estimate it from kind of network we are connected to. In this case could be a fixed value.
A more clever implementation would be to estimate it from RTCP feedback. It would be pretty obvious from RTCP info, but rather complicate in terms of real implementation as needs to change pjmedia. It's more or less the same problem than for adaptative bitrate that is a big wish I have for Opus implementation (and would be awesome for video codecs too).
A pragmatic approach for first step is to set a fix value. From silk code comments I would say that something between 2% and 16% is a value that should not impact too much bandwidth usage and still gives some FEC info.</p></markdown-widget>
