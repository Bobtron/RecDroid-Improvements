Nighliets 656 in the audio version comes out again by one speaker to lg optimus P500. I wonder what the best codec to use for 3G internet and spend a little and has good sound quality. I wonder what to do to improve call quality and it always got delayed 2 to 4 seconds in the voice processing. I use voip intervoip operator and that a clone of betamax</p>

<p>As per latency....
Actually, I really think that it depends on the device in your case. Some manufacturer do not implement "real time" audio driver. So that third party applications (other than the Telephony App), can't use it a perfect way. On other devices, for example on nexus one and HTC devices, it's almost instant.
On samsung galaxy S for example it depends on the ROM version...
So this is really linked to the manufacturer and third party applications developers can't do miracles.</p>

<p>Besides you wrote that you use Speex echo cancellation. As far as I know, Optimus One does not support armv7a CPU, as consequence no floating point and as consequence I <em>deeply</em> recommand to NOT use speex echo cancellation. Else there is conversion between floating and fix point and that overload CPU and result an awful quality.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>And forgot to reply about codecs :) </p>

<p>Have a look here :
<a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Codecs">http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Codecs</a></p>

<p>You'll see that pcmu/a (g711) is 64kbits/sec. Which as consequence will not work very well on mobile network. 
However mobile network bandwidth available for a user depends of :
* the technology (edge, gprs, 3g, hdspa)
* the number of people using the antenna at the same time that you.</p>

<p>For example I'd change to test here where there is almost nobody using the 3G antenna... And I was amazed to see that quality is excellent even with PCMU (which is the worse codec regarding bandwidth consumption).
(... in fact my available bandwidth here in 3G is better than when I use wifi ! but that's cause there is almost nobody connected on this antenna...).</p>

<p>So if you'd like to use optimised codec for low bandwidth use case (3g in a big city),
you should use iLBC (15kb/s and good quality), or GSM (13kb/s but poor quality - actually the same that you have with your mobile GSM ;) ), or speex 8kHz (adaptative codec so could overload bandwidth but you can get good results)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Again your device has not a CPU that support armv7a. As consequence no floating point !</p>

<p>As consequence speex echo cancellation mode (which requires floating point) and iLBC features will <em>NOT</em> work on your device. You can try to test it cause I leave these features even for armeabi devices (cause some has such a huge CPU that it does not matter that there is the need of converting from fix to float constantly). 
But these ones only works normally on armeabi-v7a devices ! And your device is not one of them ... 
(For a list of armv7 devices : <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Platforms/Android">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Platforms/Android</a> in System Requirement section there is the list of armv7 and armv6. Yours is armv6 so NO floating point ! )</p>

<p>So, that's absolutely not a bug. CSipSimple rely on some other opensource stuff. Speex echo canceller has (as far as I know) only one implementation in fixed point. So this feature is not compatible with your device.
As for iLBC the only opensource implementation available is in fixed point too. The floating point implementation is not open to opensource developpers... As consequence not working on your phone too ! (By default it is disabled if it's an armv6 device... you have probably activated it by hand ...)</p></markdown-widget>
