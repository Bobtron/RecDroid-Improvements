1. When I loose SIM network coverage, but still have wifi coverage. The sip is automatically registered, allthough I have stated that it should be available ONLY for outbound calls</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><p>When I click on the app icon, the quick settings page is shown again, with the original settings selected (inbound selected too)</p></li>
<li><p>When I disable wifi and re-enable it, or when I reboot the phone most of the time the same happens</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I would like Csip simple to ONLY place outbound calls over wifi,3g or gprs. Whatever happens, these settings should not be forgotten if possible ;-) So it should never register the SIP account unless the application is in view on my screen. Normally this works, I can click the "back" arrow in my SGS-i9000 once settings are stored again, and registration is terminated, but then when one of the above steps take place (step 1 is most clear) Csipsimple auto registers without me starting the application, and when I do the settings are lost again, and it shops me the quick settings page.</p>

<p>What version of the product are you using: Multiple versions up until the lates nightly from the 22nd, I use it on Android</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>Maybe a bit of a double explanation here and there, but I hope you get the point. Anyways, thanks a lot for making this software freely available.</p></markdown-widget>

Again csipsimple registered after reboot, and the quick settings showed after starting the app. After looking at the account settings I noticed the sip supplier had also changed.. Although it did register (but maybe that's a feature of betamax.. I use intervoip, but the config was set to 12 voip.

<p>Is the app installed on the sdcard?</p>

<p>It sounds like settings are lost somewhere but that's weird cause all of that relies on the standard android settings system (which is provided to all apps and should be stable).</p>

<p>Also quick other questions to try to eliminate basic possible root of problems:
 * Is there another sip application installed on the phone (mainly, is there a fork of csipsimple installed on the phone -- list of known forks : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/BrandedVersionsOfCSipSimple?wl=en">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/BrandedVersionsOfCSipSimple?wl=en</a> )</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Could be interesting to check the status of the phone storage (if it's full maybe android drop some app cache)</p></li>
<li><p>Is the phone rooted and if so is there special apps that aim to backup/restore other apps settings. Since CSipSimple announce to not allow its backup/restore from other app it should be done but...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll do an extra check on the betamax wizard, cause sounds there is a problem in it regarding your last comment. (I think this problem is not linked to other things you are experimenting, and is probably due to a bug in this wizard)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As for the memory used by csipsimple, that's weird, it should contains data stored by csipsimple for settings. 
Maybe we are in a limit case where android store settings in some temporary memory that it reset automatically. I never really tried this kind of case, maybe there is something I should do to ensure android OS cry about the fact it can't save settings. I don't really know how android API behaves in this kind of situation. I'll do more searches on my side. If you get some results with the other phone do not hesitate to let me know.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>My Froyo.Doc_V4.0 (XXJPU) version seems to keep having the issues mentioned in the topic start. Also the change you made to the BetaMax registration does not work on my phone.</p>

<p>All else works fine on the phone, and I do not have any issues with other apps forgetting user settings. Odd.</p>

<p>Did you find anything, and/or are you still interested in pursuing this issue?</p>

<p>I could upgrade my Rom, just don't really feel like it</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Found the cause:</p>

<p>Tech. explanation:
Samsung tried to fix their lag/freezes SGS issue by moving application settings from slow flash (/data/data) to internal NAND memory (/dbdata/databases/), unfortunately they "forgot" to add code to clean up these settings when application is uninstalled.
So, if application is uninstalled, old preference files are kept. The next time application gets installed, it won't be able to read/save its settings due to the old preference files kept by the system, but still owned by old app UserID. 
Each application installation generates new app UserID, thus old preference files can't be read by app with the new UserID.</p>

<p>This bug affects any application which uses preference files. 
Uninstall app A, install some other app B, install app A again - you get no settings saved for app A anymore.</p>
