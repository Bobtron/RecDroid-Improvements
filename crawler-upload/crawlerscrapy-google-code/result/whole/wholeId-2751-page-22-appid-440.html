<p>Well, first to say is that I'm from Epygi technical support team, we develop hardware IP PBXs and gateways(www.epygi.com).</p>

<p>I'm registering Csip on our PBX locally, using WiFi, no NAT, no firewall.</p>

<p>It registers with no issue and can even make call to the PBX IVR or other users, but it can't accept any call.</p>

<p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Make an incoming TLS call</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Csip should ring, but it does not.PBX cant establish TCP/TLS handshake.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
0.04-04 r1916(latest at the moment), Gingerbread, 2.3.4</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>Let's say I set TLS port to be 1111 and I expect that all TLS connections CSip will originate from the same defined port. but when I make a network capture, I see that CSip is using random port to initiate the TCP/TLS connection(When sending SIP REGISTER), the defined port 1111 is just used into the SIP REGISTER "Contact" field. This port difference(between actual TCP connection port and the port in "Contact" field) brings to unsuccessful TCP handshake and thus to unsuccessful incoming calls.</p>

<p>This is very easy to reproduce, all you need is just to make a network capture and pay attention to the mention ports.</p>

<p>I would expect the CSip application would use the defined TLS port not only in the "Contact" header, but would initiate all TLS connection from the same and only from that port. Please correct me if you find me wrong.</p>

<p>I really appreciate your work, it is a cool application:)</p>

<p>Thank you for your efforts.</p>

<p>Regards,
Vahan.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>By "set the TLS port to be 1111", do you mean the local TLS binding port in global settings ?</p>

<p>If so be aware it's only the listening port, and as you know to connect another server (connect the socket) it needs to use another port as it's TCP/TLS and not UDP. That's how the app can connect several remote sip servers ;)</p>

<p>In order to register with the accurate port on your server csipsimple (actually pjsip) has some option called "Allow contact rewrite". From your description I think you disabled it, but maybe not for the good reason ;).</p>

<p>With this option enabled what will happen ? :</p>

<p>Well first the app will register with port 1111 to your server. It uses this listening port first as the app could virtually be reachable from any other sip client/server on this port. But it's actually not the good one and the "allow contact rewrite" is there to solves that if necessary.</p>

<p>From the 200OK it will get it will know what is the actual port as seen by the server as the binded socket (from Via header). 
Note here that whatever you are NATed or not the resolution here is accurate as will be replied by your server. That's why this method is safe and can be applied whatever the network topology you have.</p>

<p>So the sip stack detects here the ip:port it has registered with to your server is wrong (when using tcp/tls it's always wrong). 
If "allow contact rewrite" option is enabled (which should be the case by default), it will send a new registration to update your server with accurate information.</p>

<p>Here, some tricky thing can happen if your server doesn't support register with an additional contact to unregister a previous one. I guess that's why you disabled the "Allow contact rewrite" option but that was not the good solution.</p>

<p>By default the app is configured to use "contact rewrite mode" to "normal". 
So at this point, the app will send a single new register, with updated info and a contact header with expires=0 to unregister the previous one (that was invalid as using listen port 1111 that cannot be used to connect to your server as already listening).</p>

<p>As some servers don't support correctly this part of sip rfc (with management of the contact with expires=0 inline in new register), there is an option in the app to use "contact rewrite mode"  "legacy". In this case the app will send a register with expires 0 and a new different register request with updated information. 
So, if you disabled the "allow contact rewrite" because of the fact you found some duplicate registrations on your server -- or double incoming calls; consider modifying this setting and keep "allow contact rewrite" enabled. 
You could also try to have a look on your server if it's possible to support contact:xxx;expires=0 in a register request to unregister an older entry ;).</p>

<p>Then once the second registration is done to your server the app will be registered with a correct IP:PORT (the one seen by your server), and your server should be able to reach it without problems (the app also takes in charges to send regular keep alives over tcp/tls to ensure the socket is not closed).</p>

<p>This behavior is part of one of the SIP RFC and is implemented in pjsip stack (it's not specific to csipsimple). Pjsip is reused in other products so you might encounter same kind of problems if other apps are configured using same settings of pjsip (on these ones it's the default of pjsip ;) ).</p>

<p>Let me know if it helps. And do not hesitate to send me logs by mail if you'd like me to dig more into logs and debug the problem with you. BTW, thanks a lot for posting it. I really appreciate when sip providers/manufacturers tries to debug issues with me :). It always benefit everyone :). </p></markdown-widget>

Allow contact rewrite has only impact on the signalization part. So, what will not work? The registration? The call media?
If it's the media, the problem is probably with your network topology and there is probably a solution by using dedicated SIP solutions for NAT traversal of media (stun/ice/turn)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>why it tell that ? Does the SDP announce a media in the same network?
I think you confuse between media and sip signaling path.
For media (rtpproxy) what's important is the SDP, not the contact header.</p></markdown-widget>
