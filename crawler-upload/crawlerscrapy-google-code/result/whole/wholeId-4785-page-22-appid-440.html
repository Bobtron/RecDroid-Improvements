none of the on screen buttons would work.  I was trying to hit speaker to

program using advanced task killer.  Since then, the speakerphone won't
turn off.  I can tap the button and the color changes like that it's either
activated or not, but it stays the same being on. Tried restarting phone
and also reinstalling but it is still stuck on inside the program.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expect to be able to turn speaker on and off.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
0.00-08 and Android 1.5 on Sprint Hero.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
The program itself seems to work great minus a few freezes every now and

<p>I've to investigate this problem. 
I know that there is a lot of issues with android 1.5 (there where many bugs in
android with native audio channels - they corrected this bug in android 1.6 but I
absolutely want to support android 1.5 since it's about 1/3 of the android devices -
so I have to get rid of this "Android" bugs in my app :( ).
I'll try to downgrade my HTC G2 to android 1.5 to be able to test under cupcake.
By the way, it has to be fixed before the beta phase (I'm still in alpha phase, and
android 1.5 starts to be critical to go to the beta phase)</p>

<p>If you are interested by alpha testing versions for android 1.5 let me know, i'll
provide on this issue my intermediates builds.</p></markdown-widget>

I've now successfully downgraded my HTC G2 to android 1.5 and I was even able to
reproduce crashes after the establishment of the call (without even succeeding to try
to activate the speaker).</p>

<p>In fact android 1.5 was even worst that I though (it has been improved a lot in
android 1.6). So I directly push my new version on the market (there is also
important fixes that doesn't depends on the android version).</p>

<p>So now, on android 1.5 you should be able to establish the call. (You must disable
Echo cancellation in Params).
The mute and speaker option has absolutely no effect (I don't really know why, but
since I have a device with 1.5 on it, it 'll be easier to fix right now).
Besides, the other big bug with android 1.5 (that I already well know) is the fact
that at the end of the call, sometimes it could crash the app (then the android task
system will restart it automatically but that's not really clean).</p></markdown-widget>

My update only fix that it crashes/freeze after the call establishment. (It was
linked to the speaker issue, but doesn't solve it yet - just make the app more stable
for android 1.5).
So globally this issue isn't yet fixed (and is now marked Started :) ), but now it
should not freeze the app anymore.</p>

<p>I'll probably send you a apk file to install soon for the speaker specific issue and
also the mute issue since it doesn't work too.
(I've to remove the bluetooth option too since it's not yet implemented too)</p>

<p>If you can just confirm me the 0.00-09 doesn't freeze the interface anymore (while in
communication) and the End Call button should well terminate the call (even if it
maybe crashes after the call is well ended).</p></markdown-widget>

(Specially the "Use mode audio api" option).
Let me know how it goes, if something helps I can modify default setting for this particular device. 
I think that in 0.00-12-19 using api mode was default for all devices while it's now deprecated in more recent versions (but the setting is still there ;) ).</p></markdown-widget>
