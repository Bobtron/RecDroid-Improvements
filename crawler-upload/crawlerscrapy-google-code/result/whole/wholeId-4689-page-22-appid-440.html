First of all I would like to say that yo have done a great job!
I'm developing an IMS/LTE (4G) client for Android (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/imsdroid/">http://code.google.com/p/imsdroid/</a>) and looking for client which support video call (H264 or Theora). I have tried SipDroid but it cannot receive video and only support H263+.
Do you plan to support video call in the coming releases?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The main technical problem is that as I use a native stack that doesn't support video yet. So it has to be modified to support video and connected to the android video system. 
So not so easy to do, and many things are remaining to support only voice and provide a good user experience.</p>

<p>But maybe if somebody hears you and want to start something on that point ... he would be welcome ... it's an opensource project ;) .</p></markdown-widget>

  <p>Video Support in the SIP stack;  &lt;&lt; actually not fully yet...</p>

<p>In fact what is released by pjsip guys is for now only the pjmedia part. So no SDP nor higher level integration.</p>

<p>The pjmedia encoding part relies on ffmpeg. As consequence even if for now few encoders are integrated, would not be so hard to get more.</p>

<p>The biggest thing we are waiting for now is for the release of teluu for the integration with the rest of the stack.</p>

<p>The thing I'm trying to treat on my side and that is far to be an minor thing to do is the device glue to get and write in the android UI.</p>

<p>I know that there is somebody that is trying to hardcode some stuff inside the current pjsua to get some proof of concept. They'll commit as soon as they'll get something. But the driver for android has to be done before...</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As for building and adding ffmpeg that's already done and available in the video branch of csipsimple.
As for the codecs if I don't mistake we will automatically benefit it from ffmpeg, isn't it?</p>

<p>For the java glue, if you want to try to do it, it will be very welcome.
To do so, try to checkout the video branch :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fvideo">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fvideo</a>
What is missing is something there :
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fvideo%2Fpjsip_android-2.0%2Fapps%2Fpjsip%2Fproject%2Fpjmedia%2Fsrc%2Fpjmedia-videodev">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fvideo%2Fpjsip_android-2.0%2Fapps%2Fpjsip%2Fproject%2Fpjmedia%2Fsrc%2Fpjmedia-videodev</a>
to make the glue with openGL (I guess that's the best choice to render video) and one with the android java API for cameras.</p>

<p>For now, pjsip guys has not yet finished everything that is missing between the pjsua (user agent) and their pjmedia library. However that's planned to be released soon as far as I understood :).</p>

<p>Meanwhile it should be possible to test the video dev using their unitary tests (for example the aviplayer.c project). </p>

<p>If you have a first patch for the video branch let me know I'll open you the svn write access to contribute ;)</p></markdown-widget>

OpenGL-es is a good idea but it's too heavy for a voip application where we only want to display the video stream "as-is". Using android "surfaceview" is easier even if it gives better performance (see main loop threading issue). The real benefit of opengl-es 2.0 could be the fact that you can draw yuv420 frames without converting them to rgb565 (to be checked). As you know the chroma conversion is one blocking point on some armv5te devices (at least 90% of the market). swscale doesn't really provide amrv5 optimized code for chroma conversion.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For OpenGL-ES vs surfaceview you have probably better knowledge than me on this field. 
I was thinking about OpenGL-ES cause that's a "standard" and could be reused on other platforms than android. 
Besides with the very bad experience I had with the audio java API (1 month of dev and still not working on all devices) and the excellent experience I had with OpenSL-ES (1 day of dev), I was thinking that OpenGL-ES could be easier but it was just a guess.
I was also thinking about all stuff that could be done through the GPU for image optimization (contrast/balance/effects/scaling). And maybe other stuff on hardware acceleration I'm not aware of.</p>

<p>Could be interesting to test both :). But, if you think it's easier to start with surfaceview I entirely trust you, as I never really tried nor opengl-es neither surfaceview :).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>And in csipsimple video branch there is the dev for the display (using opengl -- if boss has an implementation with surface view it will be welcome to bench both implementation).</p>

<p>As for capturing I started something too. For now I have preview. next step will be to push frames to native stack. </p>

<p>There is also something to do about converting frames from different color space. ffmpeg lib should be helpful, but I'd like to use the pjsip wrapper around ffmpeg libswscale.</p>

<p>I was not very reactive on the issue list all this week end and probably all the rest of the week cause of that point... :) Obviously I can't do support + dev at the same time ;) .

<p>It was done between csipsimple on nexus one and my pc (ubuntu) running pjsip.
For now pjsip-2.0 only support (I think so) h263 CIF which result poor quality. As it relies on ffmpeg lib I guess other codecs will come shortly.</p>

<p>For now hard to say how quality will finally be using a good codec, but video flaw seems to be pretty good. As the N1 camera already support CIF size there is no scale operation on capture and as I use opengl-es to display it the resize of display in done by GPU (I guess...) so the only CPU work is to encode/decode codec + change pixel format. 
Unfortunately, opengl-es 1 does not support pixel formats used in the codec I tested - however I'm wondering if for some conversion a pixel shader could not do the trick...</p>

<p>So this is a good news, however do not expect something for daily use soon. 
pjsip-2.0 is still in dev and other things has to be done before having this landing. (Modular stuff (tls/video/codecs) in csipsimple for example).</p>

<p>If you want to build and test it it's available on the video branch of this svn. Build it yourself if you want to test : I've not yet checked all licenses of ffmpeg parts so I do not release anything. Besides as it require to build on pc it must be used by expert only for now... I don't want users to cry about the fact it's incomplete ;). </p>

<p>Of course, any contribution to the video branch will be welcome if you build and improve it :)</p></markdown-widget>

I'll release soon on the market and then will focus more to provide a build of csipsimple with a real support of video. Pjsip project has now h264 support which would make video calls much more interesting than just QCIF h263 which I was able to test ;).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Then download ffmpeg for Android from Bambuser project (<a href="http://bambuser.com/opensource">http://bambuser.com/opensource</a>)</p>

<p>Follow the instructions in the file README to compile the project ffmpeg-android of Bambuser.</p>

<p>Once compiled ffmpeg for Android, put the folder in</p>

<p>/home/gio/..../folder_name/pjsip_android-2.0/apps (at the same level of pjsip).</p>

<p>Replace the folders: swig_tools and apps in the pjsip of the trunk version and then follow the build instruction at: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/HowToBuild">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/HowToBuild</a></p>

<p>Your build are only under armeabi-v7a and not armeabi</p>

<p>../CSipSimple/libs/armeabi-v7a</p>

<p>To all others.... the very very very first alpha version is available here :
<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/video/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/video/</a></p>

<p>THIS IS AN pre-ALPHA !!! PLEASE, do not report me bugs about this one. There is many missing things, only h263, and crashes after each call and UI is weird... but just don't worry, I know about that. This is just for tests.</p>

<p>Quick additional infos :
 * only h263. (h264 tests I did were not succesful at all, I guess pjsip still have things to do on this point to provide something clean -- or could be on my side with the video dev glue)
 * You may observe big latency on playing way. To avoid to cumulate latency use Jitsi on your pc to test for example. (I do my tests using pure SIP to SIP calls (no server). I don't know yet why we have such a latency - maybe on pjsip rtp management or on my opengl renderer (pjsip-2.0 is still you and my device is even more young ! )
 * Obviously network bandwidth is really really important to get good result ;)
 * It should be compatible with armv6 and armv7 on android 2.0 and upper devices. (I even did a test on a x10 mini).
 * It will consume a lot of CPU cause (I guess) the video capture on android tries to get frames as frequently as possible. On SGS I observe around 80% CPU. </p></markdown-widget>

Can you collect some logs (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page). Maybe I'll find some interesting clue.</p>

<p>I'll add very soon the option in the user interface to setup video codec. It will also need some option about video codec config that I don't know yet how to show :). 
The bitrate setting seems very important to get something with less packet loss ( there is also interesting investigation done on pjsip mailing : <a href="http://lists.pjsip.org/pipermail/pjsip_lists.pjsip.org/2012-March/014238.html">http://lists.pjsip.org/pipermail/pjsip_lists.pjsip.org/2012-March/014238.html</a> it's for ipad, but I guess that it will goes almost the same on android )</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I've just tried the steps provided above, to try out the video call feature. However the called party responses with "400 Bad SDP" when the "Use Video" option is enabled. 
Could you take a look at this problem? It seems to me the the video media part in the SDP didn't contain any video codec. I'v neither found video codec listed in the client under the Settings/Media/Codecs part. Here is the SIP trace I hope it helps:</p>

You also have to enable video calls in settings (calls settings) and let account auto-transmit/show in expert wizard mode.
You can then check that the video plugin is correctly loaded in media settings &gt; codecs. You should see H263 and H264.
Then, you can try a call, and if remote party and server(s) on the middle are compliant with video calls it should work. If not you should try investigate logs (I can help with that, see HowToCollectLogs wiki page).
However, keep in mind that's still under development and not made for production use. There is a lot of optim missing and the csipsimple ui has just very basic support of video (there is no button to make a video call - and no button to turn video on/off during a call).</p></markdown-widget>

I tried a call and send a log to [developers at csipsimple dot com] with issue 112 in the begining of the message.
I use the SIP server of Telekom Slovenije, which is based on Counterpath core (main client is banded Counterpath Bria for windows).
CSipSimple works fine (with STUN=voip.mobitel.si for NAT-ed LAN) for voicecalls, but video part doesn't work. Could you, please, verify the log file to check what should be wrong.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Currently, I have finished to build Csipsimple as 
library and use this library to build another Voip App, I have built another app successful with audio call. Now I want to develop video call feature in my app with Csipsimple API. Because I have seen there are some APIs in Csipsimple library which seem to use to make video call, but I have some wrong with these API, I have configure the SipConfigManager.USE_VIDEO is TRUE property before I call API to start Sip service, and put TRUE to Sipsession.OPT_CALL_VIDEO and replace makecall() API by makecallwithoption(). But I'm not successful, anyone have experience please help me about this.</p>

<p>I also have seen we have to install the videocallplugin in Csipsimple app on the device to use video call feature. Are there some things wrong here?</p>

<p>Thanks.   </p></markdown-widget>

Video is not ready to land in any product for now and so it's not yet supported officially in API (only those that understand the inside code can use it and help to debug -- if other tries to use it will make us loose time to get it land for anyone).
Else, yes you need the video plugin, you also need to turn on the video option in settings and you need to use the csipsimple in call control view (as for now it's the only one able to manage the video stream and it uses something that is not available in the external API to do the rendering for technical reason that will be solved later).</p></markdown-widget>

I hope all is going well. In fact I can see CSS project is moving forward.:)
I have tested recent version and have found progress in video. During my tests in our EuroTELEFON network I can have perfect video connection while initiated from our EuroTELEFON Video app on PC to my CSS on LG P880 or Samsung Note 2, but if the call is initiated from an android device to the PC app or to other CSS on another device, CSS does not even try to show video windows. I have checked logs on our VoIP server and it shows that the connection was established with codecs for video (H264) on both directions, so the problem is probably on CSS side. If you need any logs I can send it to you, but I hope you still have access to your account in ET. However, I would be happy to provide any help from our side. </p></markdown-widget>
