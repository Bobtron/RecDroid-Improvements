<p>What's more strange is, I've managed to make a couple of calls before noticing the icon. Now that I know that the icon isn't an issue I think that my VOIP provider might have problems with SIP Softwares for mobile phones.</p>

<p>I've tried another couple of softwares and all calls were muted as well.

<p>Right now, I'm not able to test the Csip using my wi-fi/3G of my mobile phone, I'll give a try later. Meanwhile, answering your question: I just use my Voip/SIP for outgoing calls (since I don't have any inbound number), and when I dial a number, the calls complete (the other person does pick up the phone), the timer keeps counting but I can't hear anything, neither the other person.</p>

<p>You've said something about the STUN, and I've made a search for it on my VOIP provider, and I got this:</p>

<p>If you have audio problems:
Use a STUN server (e.g. stun.justvoip.com) with port 3478 (if supported by your device).
Use the G.711 codec.</p>

<p>My question is, where should I fill this information? Couldn't find it on the:
Add Account &gt; Generic Wizards (Basic, Advanced and Expert)</p>

<p>And once again, don't mean to get repetitive, but on my first run of Csip, I've made a couple of calls without any problem, somehow, after trying it later, no more sound.</p>

<p>Thanks once again for your support.</p></markdown-widget>

For stun as it's not linked to the account setting it is in csipsimple global settings.
Go on dialer screen, press menu and -&gt; Settings &gt; Media &gt; STUN. (tick the checkbox and you can fill the stun server with the one of your provider, but counterpath's one should be ok too... stun is not linked to the provider, it's just a service that allow the phone to know his IP in the public network).</p>

<p>However, if you get it worked previously, it's probably not STUN (unless you were trying on wifi previously and then in 3G -&gt; STUN is done to solve NATed network problems, and your 3G network is probably NATed while your Wifi network is probably not NATed).</p>

<p>Another cause could be the fact you installed (or started) another Sip client on your android while using CSipSimple. 
Sip clients usually listen on the same ports, so they can conflicts if running at the same time (even if running in the background... I recently had the problem with somebody else who had sipdroid running at the same time of csipsimple and was not able to get any sound... cause sipdroid was blocking media ports).</p>

<p>So keep me in touch.
If you can produce logs, it can also help me (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The CSip is working perfectly and the problem wasn't the STUN server.
What hapenned was, I've changed the Wi-Fi network, and somehow it started to work.</p>

<p>I guess the previous location (hotel) wi-fi network had someking of restriction, you've mentioned the network being NATed or not, so, maybe the previous network that wasn't working, had the NAT disabled?</p>

<p>I'm asking this, just to make sure of how should I configure my home router when I get back there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this ticket may be closed, because the CSip is working 100%.
By the way, after testing quite a lot of SIP softwares, the CSip is the best one by far, for it's interface, easy-to-use and Android integration, it's just great! I could say that it's even better than my Linksys PAP2 SIP device.</p>

<p>Just got to know, how to edit the Dialing Rules on it to make it even better, so I won't need to keep dialing those bunch of 00 + country code + area code + weather forecast + destination number.</p>

<p>Thanks once again Regis!</p></markdown-widget>

This interface allow you to :
Rewrite numbers dialed from the android native dialer for this account :
you can choose "rewrite " begin with 0 by 00.
Then when you'll dial from android dialer or clicking a contact ;in the list of choices GSM will not be rewritten and sip will be rewritten.
You can also use this interface to ignore some numbers or to automatically use sip (if available ) for others... (all that stuff is for android native, for CSipSimple one as you choose the account in the dialer it's more logical to keep what the user is typing assuming it doesn't need to be rewritten ).

<p>I'm having the same problem here:</p>

<p>I have a Samsung Galaxy S I9000B
Android 2.1</p>

<p>I used Csip a couple of times ok.</p>

<p>When i changed interface do integrate with native dialer, sound stopped working...</p>

<p>One other thing, the times i used the sound was reproduced on the loud speaker on the back, and not on the front ear speaker.</p>

<p>I will try a different network this afternoon, but this is my home network and it should work here...</p>

<p>I also was using stun already when it stopped working..</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I did not fixed my problem with sound, but I know what does cause this error (at least in my case), what happens is some wireless network does not allow sound on CSIPSIMPLE, and others does.</p>

<p>Try connecting to another wireless network.</p>

<p>Don't know exactly what kind or how should you configurate the wireless network, neither if it´s somekind of hardware incompatibility. For instance, I own a Linksys WRT54G router and it works perfectly. But in some hotels and even airport the sounds insists in not working at all.</p>

<p>Maybe the developer (r3gis) might have more information on this.</p>

<p>Boa sorte com o seu SIP.</p></markdown-widget>
