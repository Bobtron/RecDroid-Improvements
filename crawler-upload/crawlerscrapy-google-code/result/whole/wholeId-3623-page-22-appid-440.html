<ol>
<li>Install csipsimple on Verizon Thunderbolt.</li>
<li>Register SIP account with sip2sip.info</li>
<li>Register incoming phone number with IPKall and point to sip2sip.info as my provider.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>I expect to receive a phone call and speak to the caller.   The call comes in, but then I get 2 android buttons that appear to notify me.  I'm not sure what that means.  Anyway I click on either one and the "answer" button appears.   When I press the answer button nothing happens and my phone continues to ring.  Strangely after some long period of time (or possibly when the incoming call times out) I can actually talk to the caller.   I've tried changing to the "non-swipe" version of the answer button but it doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>R990 secure version.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>This is all I can tell you right now.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>In fact, to reply with this kind of UI you have to press the answer jog (on the left of the screen) and drag it to the right of the screen. 
If you press and release it will indeed do nothing at all.</p>

<p>However normally the non-swipe version should produce the correct thing. </p>

<p>So maybe there is another problem.</p>

<p>Can you :
Send screenshot (or just a picture from a camera) of the first "two buttons" (I'm wondering if you have not a forked version of csipsimple installed on your phone that could conflict with the main install of csipsimple).
Logs (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page) when you receive a call. </p></markdown-widget>

<p>Actually in the default installation of csipsimple, when the call
comes in I do get a slide answer button and it does slide over.   It's
just that when I let it go, it doesn't accept it.</p>

<p>The same for the simple button.  I press it and the phone keeps
ringing.   In fact I keep tapping it, but with no result.</p>

<p>Is there a minimum version of Android I need to be running?   I was
about to upgrade to CyanogenMod7, which is currently running
Gingerbread.</p>

<p>I'll read the log collection document and send you what I find.</p></markdown-widget>

Newly installed CSipSimple.  Voipfone account.  Galaxy S2 phone (2.3.3). Registered with Voipfone.  Everything works fine - except -
Incoming call - answer screen comes up on Galaxy S2 phone (red and green buttons).  I slide the green button and it seems to answer the call,  but the call drops out after about 3 or 4 seconds,  and the caller hears dead line.
I changed the buttons to the regular 'press to answer',  and it made no difference.
The answer button did work once (not the first time - just a random time after many attempts),  and I was able to hold a conversation,  but only once,  for no particular reason,  and it hasn't worked since.
I can make outgoing calls,  no problem.  Just can't accept or answer them.
Any ideas?

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>@maxim : might be linked to packet size. 
Using UDP as transport there is a common problem for everybody: udp packets sizes are limited by some network. The size limit is not predictable and in case a network equipement in the middle decide to not transmit a packet the app is not informed. In this case it will timeout and never get the confirmation from the server that the call request has reached the sip server (and so the answer button does not disappear as not taken into account by the server yet).
Using TCP as transport, there is a problem on official nexus 4 rom (was the case for 4.0.x to 4.2.. I didn't tested for 4.3 yet). The effect was the same than the previous (with UDP) but the root cause was slightly different (a bug in nexus 4 rom)</p>

<p>For these reasons, in order to solve this kind of problem a common fix is to try to reduce sip packet sizes.
To do so :
 - try to reduce the list of enabled codecs to the minimum you need (in settings &gt; media &gt; codecs)
 - try to enable 'compact sip mode' (in settings &gt; network)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Running latest csipsimple (from Google Play) on a Samsung Galaxy SIII (GT-I9300) with stock Android 4.1.2</p>

<p>Using ostel.co as backend to chat with friend who uses proprietary software (Acrobits softphone) on his end.</p>

<p>We've been chatting for months now without problems - today we simply cannot answer each other's calls! My friend also cannot answer my calls - even with the different piece of software! When he rings me, I press the green button on csipsimple but it does nothing - the call just keeps ringing. Hanging up (with the red button) works.</p>

<p>I have tried enabling 'compact sip mode' on my end - no difference.</p>

<p>How can we know which codec is used during a call?</p>

<p>Any other advice to troubleshoot this frustrating behaviour much appreciated.</p></markdown-widget>

When I use voipvoip as a provider then it works fine</p>

<p>When I use OnSip then I get this issue.
When I answer the call, I get audio working fine in both directions. But the "end call" button doesn't show up, and instead of the call timer I get "INCOMING CALL" still showing. After about 30 seconds of being able to talk to each other then the call will drop and show up as a missed call.</p>

<p>With the same provider outbound calls from CSipSimple work fine.
With other client, inbound calls from this provider work fine.
It seems like the audio is negotiated successfully but some other part of the negotiation does not complete and then CSipsimple decides that the call was not actually answered.
With the provider that works fine I also see that it takes a few seconds after answering the call before the call timer starts running and the End Call button shows up, again pointing to some final call negotiation step that doesn't complete.</p></markdown-widget>
