                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well a new version is available but... in fact there were already a easy solution in all previous versions to solve this issue :</p>

<p>Some devices (X10, galaxy i7500 and i9000) audio driver is not really stable with 16kHz audio streams. Setting Frequency (in Option &gt; Media) to 8KHz will solve audio stack deadlocks.</p>

<p>To be absolutely sure everything is good now, a new version (that also ensure a better audio routing).</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-05.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimple_0.00-12-05.apk</a>.</p>

<p>Install it. Ensure that Options &gt; Media &gt; Frequency is set to 8kHz. 
It's now the default value but if a previous version is installed 16kHz can still appear.</p>

<p>This analyze confirms that in some configuration there is no problem (when the codec in use force 8kHz audio stream - which can be different from 8kHz data stream).</p>

<p>Just a last point : on Sony Ericson has a conceptual point of view of the MICRO source. It appears that micro stream include audio playback line ! 
I played all the day long with an X10 (great thanks goes to a colleague who lent it). Thanks to these test I understood that 16kHz audio pledge the CPU in this implementation. Unfortunately I didn't find a work around to prevent the micro source to be mixed with audio output. The result is that you will ear clearly what your remote contact say.... 
But your remote contact will become crazy with it's own echo. </p>

<p>So question to the X10 owner, did you find a android sip application without this problem (remote user ear his voice)?</p>

<p>If no, we probably should open a bug for Sony Ericson devs. They will probably more focus this point if they implement 2.1 since changes in the 7 API clearly make a distinction on the mic source (mixed or not to output voice).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I will search more about the error that could explain the fact mic doesn't work well.
For reference : 
ERROR/(2160): AFCCreateReSampler: avAFCInfo-&gt;bUsed[0] inSampleRate[44100] outSampleRate[8000] nChannel[2] outbitDepth[16]</p>

<p>There is only one google result for this one... on stackoverflow but no answer :(
Seems to be specific to Galaxy S.</p>

<p>On your side, can you try to do the same tests disabling both echo cancellation and voice auto detection. 
(Uncheck Menu&gt;Option&gt;Media&gt;Echo cancellation &amp; Voice audio detection).
Another interesting test could be to enable PCMU and PCMA codecs and disable GSM codec: Menu&gt;Option&gt;Media&gt;Codecs long clic on codec to enable/disable it. 
According to provided traces, you have probably already disabled GSM but as your asterisk only support GSM, PCMU and PCMA, pjsip fall back to GSM to allow the call.</p>

<p>Thx again for your tests.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>On my HTC magic I get a choppy sound with quality 4 using GSM codec. But setting media quality to 3, disabling VAD and disabling echo cancellation make things going really better (from something that you can't ear to something pretty clear).</p>

<p>The other solution I have is to use PCMA instead of GSM.</p>

<p>Seems to be a little bit tricky to find out what are the good params and on what device :).
Probably we should try to start writing a wiki page.
We should probably also define what should be default values for audio parameters. Technically not a problem to define different params for different phones.</p></markdown-widget>

I tested according to the above, but it's still the same as before.</p>

<p>The first I set both echo cancellation and VAD disabled.
Second, I set the available codecs that
 1) enabled GSM, ulaw, alaw.
    =&gt; csipsimple (GSM 8KHz) &lt;---------------&gt; Bria (G711u 8KHz)
    =&gt; csipsimple (GSM 8KHz) &lt;---------------&gt; Acrobits (ulaw)
 2) enabled just ualw and alaw. It was the same as 1).
    =&gt; csipsimple (GSM 8KHz) &lt;---------------&gt; Bria (G711u 8KHz)
    =&gt; csipsimple (GSM 8KHz) &lt;---------------&gt; Acrobits (ulaw)</p>

Today, I'll build a new version that should improve CPU usage. And maybe it will be intersting to test with it.
Besides, as it is probably an issue with the codec that is used, it would be interesting to deactivate some codecs such as ilbc or speex for example that seems to use a lot of extra cpu to encode/decode things. (This could be done with the old release and the new one)
I'll notify the thread today when the new release is available.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Well this said, maybe worth to try the latest build that consume less cpu. But I'm not confident on the fact it will solve the issue since really match the problem described on stack overflow and really seems to be linked to a bad audio driver from Samsung (maybe as it was reported to me, the latest rom from samsung for galaxy S solves things).

<p>As for frequency and quality settings 8Khz and quality of 4 should be good enough but on such a device we should be able to reach quality of 5 and frequency of 16kHz (that's what I use on my nexus one).
For codecs, disable ilbc there is issues with this one. It consume a lot of cpu (and besides I'm not sure if there is not a bug / cpu leak in it). I advise also to disable speex (as it consume a lot of cpu too). If you are using wifi PCMU/A should be ok. </p>

<p>Last point, if the device fall in this awful state that I don't know yet how to solve (android-devs didn't reply to my answer on the android-dev group)... but in that case, on some devices and for an unknown reason, the entiere audio stack of the device is frozen. It means that if you enter this state the only way I found to restore a good state and be able to call again is to reboot the phone. (I observed this problem only on galaxy spica i7500 &amp; sony x10 for now). If you want to quickly test if you are in this case, try to play music using the standard music application... if nothing happens, let me know I'm interesting in listing all devices for which we are able to reproduce this issue....</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For stun server that strange. With my config I never need neither stun nor turn nor ice to get it working. Just simple direct configuration works properly. Is there special firewalls, network architecture in front of your wifi access point?</p>

<p>Thanks for the log, it well confirms the fact that nothing is get from the mic. Can you get some logs a little bit before these one (when call is established). You can directly send it to me by mail if you don't want your personal infos to be displayed on the website.</p>

<p>So, you confirmed that issue with galaxy S is different from the one with i7500 and X10. That's a good news in one side but also a bad one since it will be more complicated for me to reproduce it and debug it. Maybe if you can get the log that appear before it could help me to ask on forums or samsung (why not). I'm particulary interested in something like that : "AFCCreateReSampler: avAFCInfo " that was the first thing I noticed with the log of another galaxy S owner.</p>

<p>P.S. : I will probably split this issue into one for galaxy s and one for X10/i7500. P.S.2: Any tests with x10/i7500 with the last version? (excepted the fact there is a big echo on x10 that's another problem due to sony implementation.... if only manufacturer has respected a good implementation of their audio drivers.... grrrr)</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Yes I'm currently diving into what is done by sipdroid. Their implementation is much more mature than mine and they probably already encounter this kind of problem. Although what I do is done in native (C) side, concepts can be reused.
There is something I'm currently trying to add regarding record process.
I'll keep you in touch when it will be done.</p>

<p>As for your first question (comment 32), there is not really high level sound system used on other devices. Most of the time they use their own private driver directly plugged to the android sound api. However there is a recent effort to port a real sound api to android. 
There is also some effort on OpenCore framework (<a href="http://www.opencore.net/files/opencore_framework_capabilities.pdf">http://www.opencore.net/files/opencore_framework_capabilities.pdf</a>) that comes on the top of alsa I think.</p>

<p>But all of these nice libs can't be directly used by application developers (since it can deeply depends on the device). - It is technically possible, (my first version of csipsimple was based on privates api) but that is dead end since maintaining one version per device (in best case by manufacturer) is really hard to do.</p>

<p>If you are interested in what are the "known" audio implementation you can quickly have an overview in each package on the android git : <a href="http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/hardware/alsa_sound.git;a=summary">http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/hardware/alsa_sound.git;a=summary</a> (this one is the glue for alsa). 
If you click "projects" you'll see other specific implementation for htc for example -- or at least .ko they provide to the community.</p>

<p>Another interesting link on this subject : <a href="http://www.kandroid.org/android_pdk/audio_sub_system.html">http://www.kandroid.org/android_pdk/audio_sub_system.html</a> . It's a little bit outdated and intended for porting android on a device, but really interesting to read.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Just for information, archos edition is intended for Archos 5 internet tablets - that has no GSM application, so my android integration is done one level upper using privates API of android. So should probably not be used on other devices. However it is the same code, the only thing that change is the manifest file. I've just pushed 0.00-12-28 that fixes a regression introduced in -12-27.</p>

<p>I've still to find out why like on the X10 there is this awful echo. I think that the reason is the same (line and mic are mixed up so I record both what come from the mic and what I diffuse on the earpiece/speaker.</p>

<p>In worse case (will be the case for X10 I think since there is no hope in the 1.6 api), I'll try to tune echo cancellation feature to remove the echo produced by this hardware implementation.</p>

Using 16kHz is also quite better, than the 8kHz, but the phone reacts a little bit slower. Using 32kHz, the phone nearly hangs.
The Quality setting is 3, the voice detection switched off and echo canc is on.
The echo on the other line end is now something between nothing and very quiet, testing over 3G call. The delay is about quarter a second.
So in overall, this are the best results, compared to the other available SIP clients for android.</p>

<p>If I set the speaker gain to 0.2, I do not hear anything on incoming calls, but on outgoing it is fine. Gain 0.2 on other hand is the best choice. 
Maybe, if the volume up/down button is working, it will be fine. I guess at the moment I do hear with gain 1.0 the highest possible volume.</p>

<p>For 48, do you reproduce when it doesn't ring? (set ringing volume to vibrate or none ). 
I ask this because I think that the fact there is a really short time when both ringing and voice are both active. It can maybe affect voice call. 
If when you deactivate ringing you get something equivalent to outgoing call, I can quickly try something to solve it.</p></markdown-widget>

After returning from UMTS to wlan, csipsimple re register the account (can see it on the symbol). But incoming calls have no sound (earspeaker).

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>To galaxy S owners :
I've released a -12-29 version.
It add an option to change a parameter called ptime. I would like to test and change it to 20. 
I ask this because, -12-27 that solve the micro issue for you has both a changed ptime value (this value is linked to latency) (from 20 to 30), and also the implementation tweak that wait before asking micro frames. If you confirm that 20 works as fine as 30 I'll put 20 as the default value (latency will be better - I mean audio latency, small compared to network latency -&gt; so you'll not ear a big difference).</p>

<p>@jarsiv : for tcp/udp issue can you send me your logs? 
Well in all case both TCP and UDP ~should~ be always activated (unless it's a really specific configuration), if you want to use TCP you should change it into the account configuration, but still interested in crash logs :) unless it's an ANR (application not responding) and so I think that I know the reason. (The application doesn't thread everything yet and sometimes it tries to register/resolve things in the user interface thread which mean a lack of responsiveness. So if your STUN server/registrar server or another server doesn't support TCP it can wait for a network timeout in the UI thread. This is a big point I have to fix but I keep it in mind.</p>

<p>@mail : New version restart everything. As you said, it's not really optimized. I don't know exactly what impact it could have on the battery. I don't think that it's so huge but for now it will solve <em>a lot</em> of problems (included wifi lock that could remains - and maybe drain more battery). Let me know if you observe a big difference with this version. Anyway I'll need to optimize this later but could help me on the priority of the task.</p></markdown-widget>

In future release for other devices than nexus one it will be un-ticked but for now since it has a deep impact on communication on nexus one it is by default enabled.</p>

<p>Besides :
- I think that the tilt to stop should be done by a third party app ;) 
- I'll try to implement soon the real proximity sensor usage (screen goes off when proximity sensor is activated) - But it requires the usage of a private android API. So for now, <em>if you disable the "keep awake while in call" option</em> =&gt; Screen will goes off when near of your head after a while (same time than the one configured in standard case). In the future (with private api) it will goes off immediately (if it is not the nexus one on wifi !)</p></markdown-widget>

The speaker on the back is now off by default. Great!
Switching between the ear and back speaker is now the same behaviour like on sipdroid. To switch on is working, to switch off again, does not work. But this is not really important.
At the first test I had no sound again, only after opening the settings screen and close it again. STUN is activated, but this issue is fixed already. I will keep an eye on it, maybe I will find a way to reproduce it.</p></markdown-widget>

For the switch off again issue there is something I can try to solve the issue. It sounds like the one I get on bluetooth and simply stop and restart the streaming with good params set before opening the stream made things work.( since for now it is done while streaming is done and switching from earpiece to speaker doesn't stop audio stream) 
The same technique could maybe solve the speaker switching issue.</p>

<p>For reference, still issues on X10 (thanks Mark for the report). 
I'll try to test on a colleague X10 next Monday (at work colleagues start to own android phones....samsung S (one received it today), a X10, and a htc desire :)... so will be easier for me to debug issues on these device... just have to convince to test my app on their phone for a couple of hour ;) )</p></markdown-widget>

<p>For the mic mute, it is quietly sure that it work properly now with 0.00-12-30 : I changed the method and now it's not managed by the android system but by the sip stack which is more reliable and doesn't depend on the device. 
So I guess something went wrong when you installed the 0.00-12-30 you had the micro mute issue. Try to fully uninstall the app and reinstall the 0.00-12-30 and let me know if you are not in the case of comment 69 now.</p></markdown-widget>

So I guess there is a wrong implementation from Samsung and I guess, this will go, if they bring the Android 2.2 Update.</p>

<p>The problem is the running back speaker.</p></markdown-widget>

Well, I pushed -12-32. I'm exploring if it's not due to the thread from which audio mode is set.
If possible could you test and send me logs you get using this one. I don't think that it will solve the issue, but behavior it will have can help me to understand what is happening. So if you can test both incoming and outgoing and both with ringer and without (for incoming).

I tried with breakpoints and even when I wait after the end of the ringing, it still goes on speaker. (Actually, it goes through earpiece + speaker). In fact, once speaker is turned on (for ringing for example), it seems to be really difficult to turn it back to off then. Android API should allow that flawlessly... So there is something wrong with Samsung implementation.
I concluded finally that it's probably worth to wait for the 2.2 release (as jarsiv said). Hope it will not be too much delayed.
Then if we reproduce the same thing in 2.2 I'll spend more time on this particular point. </p>

<p>Would have loved fring share their experience on that point (since they seems to succeed in solving this issue) but my last tentative on their forum was a dead end... </p>

<p>Another point, when I tested on the phone of my colleague, I was a little bit disappointed with sound quality. I think that there is still improvements I can do on that point on galaxy S (and probably all alsa based driver). I'll do more test/debug session on galaxy when possible.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>So is it possible that while you are calling (and put the phone on your ear) with csipsimple it turn off the screen? Like Galaxy S does with normal GSM calls. And it will turn on the screen when you take the phone off on your ear (like Galaxy S does with GSM calls)</p>

<p>It think it uses lightness sensor or orther to find are you talking or what.</p>

I'm trying to implement something stable for other devices and also for galaxy S in the same code... not so easy :)</p>

<p>However, will not solve speaker issue. This one I've to spend more time to solve it :)</p>

<p>@jarsiv : latest builds (such as -13-01-bis) should already use proximity sensor of the device if any (provided the fact the keep awake while in call option is not manually set to true). 
But as you stated, if galaxy S doesn't use a real proximity sensor it will be harder for me to implement. But as I'm based on the same (private) API than the official telephony application... unless they also re-implement the all telephony application...</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Sounds better than first version without anything done for alsa based driver but indeed, not good enough compared to -12-3x series.
I have to find the good compromise since it the implementation that works flawlessly on galaxy S introduce a regression on some other devices. 
But, it's encouraging since this version give good results for other device and not ~so bad~ for galaxy S. 
So now, I have to find the good value for a parameter in my code to make it perfect for all devices.</p>

<p>Stay tuned, I'll probably ask you for more tests soon :)</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As for connection that's a strange behavior. What you describe could happen if the wifi connection is lost for example or if your IP is changed by the network.</p>

<p>For audio quality, on 3G, you should try with a low bandwidth codec. For example try to enable only GSM codec or only iLBC (PCMU has no compression).  The other side (or your sip server must also support the codec, else call will directly finish).</p>

<p>Maybe could be a great things if you can get logs if you can reproduce the issue.
If you can try the latest version available on the download section, there is a facility to collect logs in menu &gt; Help (press record logs, reproduce the issue and once reproduced, go back in settings and stop &amp; send logs).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The first time I tried CsipSimple on 2.1 I accidentally modified the order of the audio codecs (the behaviour of this menu could be improved, see below). I succesfully made several calls and received calls via both WIFI (11g) and UMTS and sometimes HSDPA. </p>

<p>There are 3 other issues (on my X10 Mini Pro) wich I suppose can be fixed easily, perhaps I should create new issues?</p>

<p>(1)
The screen orientation of the settings/accounts menu don't change! Even when typing on my keyboard, the screen orientation stays vertical.</p>

<p>(2)
The Codecs menu works different from any other Android menu: when you scroll (touching the screen) you are actually moving one codec up or down, modifying the order of the codecs unintendedly! Could you change this or at least add a RESET button with a warning not to mess with the order if there is no need for it?</p>

<p>(3)
Only once CsipSimple crashed. While I was doing nothing, Sip accounts were registered and my phone was idle. I think the cause could be in the logs, but I have no idea where the logfiles are, hints? So I can upload them for you.</p>

<p>At this point I can already recommend all X10 Mini Pro owners on Android 2.1 to use CsipSimple!</p></markdown-widget>

Great :)</p>

<p>Well for point 1, portrait mode is locked cause it introduce bugs. I've to focus on this particular issue but that's not critical for me. I've just received a X10 mini and if something is not useable on QVGA I'll fix it directly in the layout.</p>

<p>For point 2 : it works just like the stock music application on android but you've not this one on the x10 mini so you are probably not used to this kind of interface :
Actually to scroll down, drag the left part of the screen. To reorder codec tap and drag the right part of the screen (where there is the little icon that indicate that lines can be reordered).
For the reset feature good idea, I'll keep that in mind when I'll refactor this view (there is another issue about codec priorities ... so I've to add features on this view I'll take the reset order in the same time).</p>

<p>For point 3 : 
If you are using the development version (available on this website) there is something in Help that allow to start log recording and stop log recording (and then send it directly to me - it avoid to publish on the web logs that's a bad idea for your privacy ;) ).</p>

<p>But I think that I know what you get, I had this one on the X10 mini I've just received, actually it's an ANR not a Force Close (ANR = application non responding). I've to check why we get that on the mini. But as I've the device now should be easy... :) </p>

<p>I've also noticed some layout issues on the mini (that probably all devices with QVGA experiment). I'll fix all of that ones ! (You'll have to thanks donators to the projects that allowed me to buy the x10 mini ;) ).</p>

<p>Just a remark, I'm pretty impressed by the X10 mini. Sony really succeeded in the android integration on this QVGA device and the speed of the device is impressive. It sounds even better than the big X10. As they have fixed their audio driver in 2.1 it is really useable now. (I did benchmark on the GPU ... x10 mini : 45fps - nexus one 25fps.... well nexus one screen is twice bigger so it's normal but however, it means that the GPU of this device is really good).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>On X10, I think that there is some default value to change on mic &amp; speaker amplification to get something usable.
