I found that ZRTP works great but after selecting to disable ZRTP on both founds, calls still automatically initiated ZRTP.</p>

<p>I deleted both OSTN accounts which re-forced the verification, but the ZRTP was still being enabled despite it being set to "No ZRTP". Only after setting both phones to enable SRTP and setting both to No ZRTP and restarting the phones did I find I could make an non-encrypted call.  Even then, after disabled STRP and enabled ZRTP on only one phone, they were both automatically encrypting phone calls again.</p>

<p>I restarted both phones again with just "No ZRTP" and STRP disabled. Calls were still being encrypted.</p>

<p>I don't think unintentional encryption is necessarily a bad thing and its a whole lot better then the opposite effect, but this doesn't seem intuitive. CSipSimple is great and I think quickly becoming the standard application for supporting ZRTP on Android phones.</p>

<p>Let me know if I can provide anymore information or help.</p>

<p>In fact there is two level of settings. one is global it can be accessed from settings menu and network &gt; secured transport and ZRTP option.</p>

<p>A second level of setting is per account.
Here (for account settings) wizard take a big part of the job by hiding most settings that are recommended/requested by sip providers. These wizard could also change global settings but that's more rare cases.
All wizard are finally just different presentation of the 'Expert' wizard that should allow to modify all possible account settings. 
It's possible to switch from one wizard to another by long pressing a row, choose wizard and by selecting the other wizard you'd like to use.
Most wizards only preset sip server domain, but other wizards does more things. </p>

<p>It's the case of OSTN wizard. It automatically turns on the <em>account</em> ZRTP setting. So whatever you'll set as global setting, the ZRTP setting of the account is yes for an OSTN account because OSTN is an easy way to present you some provider as "secured providers" because they are known to support some features (ZRTP included).</p>

<p>So, if you want to disable the ZRTP option for an account managed by the OSTN wizard, you have to switch to a different wizard. 
In this case, you should use the expert one.
So, transform your account into an Expert account (don't remove and recreate, just long press the row and "choose wizard" or press menu while editing the account options). 
Then, you'll see then a lot of settings in the account options. Near to bottom there is the ZRTP option (don't care about other settings, it's already pre-filled thanks to previous OSTN wizard).</p>

<p>You'll see that ZRTP option is set to Force enable (because of the creation through the OSTN wizard).</p>

<p>You can switch to "Auto" which just rely on the global setting, just as all other wizard does. Or to "Disable" if you want this account to never use ZRTP even if enabled at global settings level.</p>

<p>That's it :).</p>

<p>It's maybe not obvious but the goal of doing that is to make things easy for mainstream users. Those who uses OSTN accounts are looking for call security, so no need to ask them again if they want to secure their call in the wizard.</p>

<p>My approach is to save as much as possible time of 99% of mainstream users by hiding settings that they probably don't want to care about, and to spend time explaining like I do to those who have questions and that I hope are pleased to understand how it works and discover the expert modes ;). 
Besides most of the time these users are actually kind of technology and I'm pleased to explain and share about the app and get feedback from them :). They are also often capable to share again the information with others and that's important for an opensource app to share how app works with users.</p></markdown-widget>
