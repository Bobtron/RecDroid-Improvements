<p>You're right, I don't handle other ongoing calls. Have to be implemented.</p>

<p>Don't know yet what is technically possible to solve this issue.
The best thing is probably to change the ringing mode.
Another solution could be to prevent gsm incoming calls while in a sip call.
Or maybe let user choose in prefs what he want to do.
I have to implement hold call feature also.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>However, when I am using the SIP phone and a regular cell phone is coming in, there is no option to accept or reject the call or stop the other phone from ringing. I will be very interested in having such an option. (maybe it should be implemented in the android OS and not by each SIP application). </p></markdown-widget>

I selected the outgoing one and terminated it. After that, I was able to continue talking normally.</p>

<p>I think the app should listen for call status broadcasts, and reject incoming calls when the mobile phone is on call, and also when a SIP call is in progress.</p>

<p>Another interesting effect: after I terminated the outgoing call and talked for a while, the screen got dark as if the device went to sleep, but there was no sound degradation! Weird.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I am not sure if it is the indended behavior. Anyway I think it is reasonable, as it allows you to put the mobile call on hold and answer the SIP call if you choose, or reject the SIP call. Maybe having vibration and/or quiet audio signal would be better.</p></markdown-widget>

In this way (GSM already established and then sip call), I think that the only thing we could imagine is some vibration... but not sure that users will be pleased with that (could be discussed or could be an option.?). </p>

<p>The best thing would have been a little bip or tone but that's only possible while in SIP and gsm is incoming (not yet done, but I can do that). 
When it's GSM that is in call, it take a kind of lock on the audio hardware. So it's worth to left GSM keep control on audio.</p>

<p>Maybe for consistency a good solution could be an option that enable some short vibration (one or two short vibration) if there is an incoming GSM while in SIP call or SIP while in GSM call. This solution is technically possible for both cases and it could be acceptable for users if that's only 1 or 2 short vibrations.
What do you think?</p></markdown-widget>

Because while you are talking you are not likely to see the screen, are you? So, either that, or short vibration would be nice to have, I think.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Your right, that was my first thought too... Unfortunately as I said, making a beep is not possible when there is an ongoing GSM call (GSM chipset and audio chipset could be directly plugged together and prevent any other application to produce sound on the earpiece/speaker). 
So I think that it's not technically possible (or at least, even if possible on some device, not enough clean cause can crash some devices).
When it's a SIP call, I can produce every beep I want... but I guess that I should do something consistent in both case (onging GSM + incoming sip and ongoing SIP + incoming gsm). </p></markdown-widget>

But it was that when you had an ongoing SIP call, and get an incoming GSM call (on the same phone) the application had something to do to manage properly the incoming GSM call that comes from the GSM application. This has been fixed normally.</p></markdown-widget>
