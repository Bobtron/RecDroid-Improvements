                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Fixed in r269 of the project. Please note, there seem to be intermittent problems, at least on my current test device of a Google IO ion phone running Android 1.6, where the audio becomes choppy in playback and the controls become unresponsive. This seems to be an android-related problem when using a2dp devices. I'll test with newer versions of the Android platform (on newer devices).</p>

<p>The workaround for the choppiness seems to be to disable and re-enable the bluetooth capability on the phone. Sometimes I also needed to reset the BT3030 to restore full functionality between the phone and the a2dp device. I noticed the problems are similar for the default music player so I don't think it's specific to the DaisyReader application.</p>

<p>If any of you can test this feature, especially with other a2dp headsets, I'd be grateful.</p>

<p>this however only seems to work when the screen is on
when the screen is off and I press any of the buttons, the screen simply turns on but the action isn't performed
if I press a second time on the control, the action is performed probably because the screen is now turned on after the first button press</p>

<p>Daisy Player plays fine in the background with the screen off, it's just the controls that don't :)
that reminds me I didn't test the controls with screen on and player in the background..</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the feedback on the A2DP support. The specific information I'd appreciate would be to know how reliable the playback is e.g. does it start to fail (like it does on my phone) from time to time. Also, which Android device(s) you're using and the Android version number(s). This information will help me understand more about the problems I've noticed to know if they're specific to a version of Android or a type of phone, etc.</p>

<p>Currently the DaisyReader stops playing at some point when it's not running in the foreground e.g. when the screen is off. It doesn't stop immediately. I need to change the player program into an android 'service' to make it play reliably in the background. This change would <em>probably</em> mean the controls would also continue to work. While I'd like to make the change to use a service soon, in practice I have other changes I want to make first, so I may take a while to implement the change. I'll announce it on the Google Group for this project when I eventually manage to make the change.</p></markdown-widget>

I'm running it on a Samsung Galaxy S II with Android 2.3.3
until now playback has been excellent
I start a book where I finished it and then turn off the screen and let it play through my stereo
I do get traffic info from time to time and then I need to rewind about 10 seconds (which is one handy swipe now :) )
traffic interruption can happen about every 25 minutes
I think 30 minutes is the longest I have let it play with screen off and it hasn't stopped during those 30 minutes</p>

<p>the issue I described above (player not pausing when pressing pauze button if screen if off) seems to make the player switch very fast between play and pauze and you can't stop this unless you close the application
this happens when I press the button a few times in a row, need to test further to be able to provide clear circumstances
I haven't experienced this issue with other music players on my phone
I did experience it on a podcast player I tried today
so that makes 2 apps who have this issue</p></markdown-widget>

Your experience of the occasional issues where the player switches very fast, etc. seems to align with my experience when playback becomes choppy. I've seen the visual behaviour you describe during my testing too. As it also affects the music player I don't think the cause is related to the Daisy Reader software, however I may be able to improve the way the software copes with this behaviour.</p>
