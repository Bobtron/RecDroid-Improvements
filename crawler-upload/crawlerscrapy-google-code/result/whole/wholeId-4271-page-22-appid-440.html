                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Csipsimple app "ongoing" in background configured/registered with sipgate.com SIP account.
2. Csipsimple set to auto-answer incoming call from specified Google Voice number via filter.
3. "Google Voice Callback" used to place call via integrated dialer interface.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>The expected result of above said configuration would be that a call placed utilizing Google Voice Callback will be auto-answered by Csipsimple, which is running in the background, and the Csipsimple UI would be displayed to handle the auto-answered call.  Though the configured filter does auto-answer the incoming call from GV, Csipsimple does not come to the foreground. Instead Csipsimple remains in the background whilst a notification stating "Call in Progress" is displayed in the notification area, leaving the user no means by which to control the call. In order to display the user interface the Android notification area must be pulled down and the "Call in Progress" notification selected, which then brings Csipsimple to the foreground.  </p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>Csipsimple version: 0.00-16 r410
Android 2.2.1</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>The idea here is to bypass the extra step of the requirement to physically answer an incoming call from a specified Google Voice number and, instead, set Csipsimple to auto-answer the incoming call and present the user the interface to control said call.</p></markdown-widget>

So duplicate of issue 388.
Read also comments on issue 70.</p>

<p>As soon as when GSM view goes up CSipSimple will re-ask for focus I think that your issue will be fixed too.</p>

<p>Was also discussed on other issue thread. Actually GSM and SIP conflicts is some hard issue to manage cause nobody wants the same behavior ;). But I'll try to do something configurable that will make pleased everyone ;)</p></markdown-widget>

The thread that this issue was merged with, from reading, sounds nothing, unfortunately, like what I'm experiencing.  Google Voice is not set to ring both my SIP and GSM accounts as I actually have no GSM account but, rather, am using an android phone as a "wifi phone", if you will.  That said, Google Voice is setup to handle/dial all calls placed via Androids integrated dialer, and the SIP account configured within Csipsimple is configured to receive all incoming calls from Google Voice.  As stated, the calls are placed and received without issue utilizing the above configuration. The issue is, though, that when the call is "placed" using Google Voice and the SIP account receives the call via Csipsimple, the app will auto-answer as it has been configured to do using an auto-answer filter, but remains in the background and does not come to the foreground as it should without user intervention. </p></markdown-widget>

Now, dialing with Google Voice Callback using the integrated dialer calls back to the SIP account setup within CSipSimple, is automatically answered, and CSipSimple jumps to the foreground as it should presenting the user with the UI to handle the call.  Bravo!   On a related note I must also say that I like the addition of the "contains" field in the filter menu. That really eases the use of the filters. I'm looking forward to continued use/testing of CSipSimple! Thanks!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I have gvcallback set to call me back using gtalk. So when I make a call from the stock dialer it rings through csipsimple because I'm using gvcallback to make free calls. With gizmo5 this use to work perfect but I've experienced issues with gizmo5 because they are shutting down the service.  So lately gizmo5 just doesn't work.</p>

<p>My incoming calls go through csipsimple. My phone uses wifi only so I don't use anything but sip/voip. My only issue is getting auto answer to work so my phone doesnt ring everytime I make a call</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Sorry if I didn't answer your question correctly but CSipSimple is the UI that is ringing. It is using pbxes which is using gtalk instead of sip. If you follow that guide above that is exactly how I have my phone set up. My phone has no sim card in it so I only use sip/voip.</p>

<p>The only thing I noticed is to get gtalk as a call forwarding option you have to place a call through your gmail account. So doing it this way negates the need for ipkall, sipsorcery, gizmo5 etc*. There's actually a device made by obihai that does this for landline phones- I was wondering why nobody made an app for android to do this but I guess using pbxes is the easiest way to do this.</p>

<p>Again my only issue is when I place a call through the stock dialer gvcallback initiates and calls CSipSimple and although I have a filter set up to auto answer my google voice number it doesn't pick up. I manually have to pick up. </p></markdown-widget>

Just to completeness, i explain why i need that: i have a voip citophone at my home ( and also i seel it ) with a camera stream mjpeg and a sip phone embedded. When someone ring, i can see a popup of the video coming in my mobile with a button "answer". Pressing this button send to an asterisk server a "command" to make it call back my phone, but if doesn't remain in background on autoanswer, i will lose the video of my citophone and also the web button to open the door.   </p></markdown-widget>
