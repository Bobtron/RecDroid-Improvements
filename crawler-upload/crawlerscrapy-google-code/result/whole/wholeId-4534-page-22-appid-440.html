1. Use cSipSimple for a while, and let the phone rest
2. After a while (an hour or less) try to make a call</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expected: Call is placed ok
Instead - Stuck on "calling" screen (not moving to Ringing)
Cannot press "End". After a while it returns to the call screen
Only solution is quitting/killing the app</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Nexus One, CyanogenMod 6. App version: 0.00-13</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
This happens for both SIP accounts.
Settings: All codecs but PCMA 8khz are disabled
Saw this on 3G connection</p>

<p>Attached logcat part where it hapenned. Please let me know what additional info you need</p></markdown-widget>

Could be really interesting to see what is sent to the sip server, and if I get some response. Just send me directly the logs by mail (better for your privacy information ;) )</p></markdown-widget>

Or at least I think allowing user to increase thread number since in your case I think it could help cause your personal sip server seems to keep sending messages to the client (that's a good idea for a PC client but for a mobile client it consume CPU and network ...and so battery). 
So in your case pbxes.org (or any sip proxy provider) is a good solution indeed, but I don't want to introduce limitations in CSipSimple (users should have the choice :) )</p></markdown-widget>

It looks like if for some reason the sipstack service is dead, or not functioning correctly, the main program is somehow unaware of the situation. The accounts will remain inactive or respond with "service unavailable". And "disconnect" option in the main program does no good. You have to kill and restart the program (sometimes multiple times) in order for the main program to restart or revive the sipstack service. Network interruption can be one of the reasons the sip stack goes dead. If the sip stack service is not self proof to recover from errors, the main program needs a more aggressive mechanism to detect and recover or revive it.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I have the same problem here (Samsung S4 mini duos). For me, I could sign in and authenticate but cannot place a call. Seems to be the same issue. Worked for a while. Then, all of a sudden it stopped working.</p>

<p>I guess there is some sequence of steps which trigger the issue, because I could see it somewhat quickly, right after restarting the phone. But I still don't know how to reproduce it precisely.</p>

<p>My bet is that there is something wrong about the integration on CSipSimple SIP/Voip stack and the native SIP/Voip mechanism on the phone itself. But it's still only a guess, since I cannot yet reproduce the issue reliably.</p>

<p>I will play with it a bit more, in case I can figure out how to reproduce the issue, I will report back and let you know.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Paulo</p></markdown-widget>
