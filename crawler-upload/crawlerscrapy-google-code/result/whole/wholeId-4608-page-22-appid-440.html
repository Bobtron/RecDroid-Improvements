However licensing issue is still a big deal to solve.
It's already a blocking point for g729 implementation (which is functional but I can't commit yet until I found a clean way to distribute it without being out-law).</p>

<p>So as for silk, there is implementation and this licensing issue to solve. So accepted issue but as a very low priority for me. If somebody want to implement it, feel free to contribute however.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>SILK SDK builds fine on android (so good point)
I've to code the glue between silk and pjsip but seems not so hard to do. However it's not high priority so I do that only when I want to code in C instead of java ;) So it may took time, but I'm about to recruiting a friend to do the task :) -- if anybody is interested anyway, he will be welcome.</p>

<p>I've followed the instruction to get their license agreement on the skype website... Still no response... (was made 2 or 3 weeks ago but well not critical since nothing is working yet). 
Seems to be the good way to obtain a distribution and developing license. I prefer to get a clear response from them about what I'm allowed to do with their codec...</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As it is stated clearly on their blog:</p>

<p>I’m speaking at eComm today, and have some very special news to bring our developer community – we’re making the SILK speech codec available for <em>a royalty free license</em> by third-party software and hardware developers soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.skype.com/en/2009/03/silk_now_available_for_free.html">http://blogs.skype.com/en/2009/03/silk_now_available_for_free.html</a></p>

<p>Given that... I would say it's pretty safe to incorporate SILK into cSipSimple now (both the code and their announcement is in agreement that SILK is free, so why not...). </p>

<p>I think their licensing team/lawyers are just incredibly unresponsive to individual developers, or just don't care... Same with me -- I requested info from them for 2 months. No response.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>GPL license ensure that the user can execute without restiction any condition the software, that he can study and modify the software, that he can copy and redistribute the software and finally improve and redistribute modifications.</p>

<p>So free and GPL are two different things and can be incompatible. For example even if free GPL apps can't be distributed on the apple app store cause the app store break the liberty to redistribute the app. Also, some other opensource software are under an opensource license that is not compatible with GPL and cannot be included inside GPL project. (Some can be re-licensed to be compatible, and others licenses need to add some exceptions to the GPL to be able to distribute/include their source code).
So really, royalty free is not enough to ensure me that what I'll do is allowed by their license. </p>

No packet lost cancellation, no voice auto detection (I don't think so maybe already done by silk itself but I'm not sure at all).</p>

<p>But 8kHz, 16kHz and 24kHz support :). Tested between two CSipSimple directly and between CSipSimple and Freeswitch implementation. Sounds good :).
As freeswitch doesn't implement over clocking on the codec I'll do not on my side. It's probably useless (internal SILK only support up to 24kHz but announce that it can goes up to 32kHz and has its own resampler.... I guess useless since pjmedia already resample if needed).</p></markdown-widget>
