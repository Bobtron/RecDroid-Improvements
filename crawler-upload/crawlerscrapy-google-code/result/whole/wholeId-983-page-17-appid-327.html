Pauses very briefly when:
- Change screen orientation OR
- Screen turns off due to timeout OR
Audio stops when:
- Pressing power button when book is playing to turn off screen OR
- Pressing home when book is playing to multi-task 
- After a while of audio playback with screen off</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
When a book is playing the audio should not break or pause or stop and behave similarly to the default music app where it will play continuously until it reaches the end of playlist or otherwsie told explicitly to stop playing music. </p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
181</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the clear bug report and the update. I've not noticed the player continuing in landscape format, I'll experiment with this as I typically use my phones in portrait format. There's nothing special in the code to behave differently in each format (apart from slightly different formats of the screen layout) so perhaps there's a difference in the way the Android software is managing the lifecycle of the application in landscape mode?</p>

<p>Also, I've worked through some of the points you report on my phones. I don't have a device with the version of Cyanogen Mod. I do have an old G1 with Cyanogen Mod, and I have a HTC G2 (mine is the version sold in the UK about 3 years old, the android software describes the phone as a T-Mobile myTouch 3G. FYI: there are several distinct physical phones that share the name G2). My G2 has a stock image of 2.2 (build number FRF64) and I've just tried to reproduce the reported issues with the current build (r193). Here's a summary:
- Screen rotation - does cause the audio to pause slightly for about a second, possibly less. I'm well aware of this issue and plan to address it, when I'll also enable the player to continue to the end of a book (similar to the way the music player works, as you've mentioned). Technically I need to change the implementation of the DaisyPlayer to use a 'service' and need to first experiment which is what's holding me back at the moment (as it'll take sigifncant time to do).
- Audio continues for a period after the screen turns off due to timeout. This seems to depend on the model and/or version of Android installed. Fundamentally this should be fixed when I implement the 'service' mentioned above.
- I wasn't able to reproduce your issues related to pressing the power button to turn the screen off, or when pressing the home key to multi-task. Also I noticed the player seems to behave reasonably well on my G2 when I've used the multi-tasking to switch to another application (e.g. SMS messaging).</p>

<p>So a couple of comments in summary:
1. I wonder if the Cyanogen Mod version you're using is indirectly causing some of the audio 'stops'? I'll pay more attention to the behaviour of the software during future testing and development. And if you happen to have another Android phone with a stock build perhaps you'd be willing to test the software on that phone to see whether the problems are reproducable on other builds and devices?</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>I fully agree it's better for the player to behave more like the music player. In fact I'm using the music player as a benchmark for how the application should behave. I'll let you know when I think I've addressed the issue (by implementing a suitable Android 'Service').</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks again for taking the time to report the issues. I appreciate your time and help with this project. Further contributions would be welcome :)</p>

<p>For your information when I refer to the HTC G2 which is codenamed Vision I am refering to the T-Mobile G2 a remarketing of the HTC Desire Z sold in Europe now and US exclusively to T-Mobile as the G2. It is not the MyTouch you are refering to. </p></markdown-widget>
