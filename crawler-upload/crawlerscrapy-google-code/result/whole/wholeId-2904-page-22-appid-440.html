<p>it can be done by the Filtering/Rewriting rule of csipsimple. You just enter the number in stock dialer and dial... the app will rewrite the number depending the account and also if there is some filter to force call or to exclude it from calls when matching a rule will force the call or exclude it from choice list.
There is rules to rewrite the number, rules to force the call using the account and rules to prevent the call using the account (there is also auto-answer rules).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You just need one preprocessor entry above all other accounts in the filter menu that has the normal filter/rewrite options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed there is no "global" filtering rule, rules are presented per account. The per account processing is more powerful than a global linear processor. But maybe indeed less user friendly for people used to linear processor.
Would be an idea for those used to these more linear filtering processors (that allows less things), to create a plugin for csipsimple that abstract filtering rules to such a model. Since the per account model allows more things; abstracting it in an user interface that present some more linear stuff is technically possible.</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Just like a home phone connected to a PBX system. You dial a number, that's it. The PBX system automatically chooses which provider to use and how to modify the number. Sometimes you may want to use a prefix to force to use one particular provider. But most of the time, your family members just dial a number and know it will connect. No confusing list to select from. </p>

<p>You just need one pre-route rule to select one provider. Without pre-routing, you need multiple rules in every account to force "not to dial this type of number" and "but force to dial this type of number in this condition" to implement the selection and de-selection of every account. Sounds like a little advantage? </p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Indeed your right. But that's just about user interface. Not about the engine.
That's why I think could be done by a third party app. CSipSimple has a full featured api that can allow third party application (granted with correct rights) to set the configuration.
So having such a system that does batch on account filtering rule is possible. </p>

<p>I think not good to introduce it in the main app because would make things very complicate to understand for users that never tried to configure a PBX system. 
I work on my full time job for pbxes and I know exactly what you mean. I don't think however that it's good approach for mainstream users use cases that rather think about accounts first and for example think :
"I'd like this account to be automatically used for numbers starting by 04"
or
"I'd like the gsm to be automatically used for numbers starting by 06"
or
"I'd like my SIP account of provider Y to never be used for numbers starting with 08"
or 
"I know that my sip provider X needs all numbers starting by + to be rewritten by 00"
or
"I'd like phone numbers with only 3 digits to be handled by my enterprise pbx"</p>

<p>I think that they'll be confused if there is another pre processor that applies all accounts (and BTW also GSM account and plugins virtual accounts -- such as webcallback plugins). And many will try to do that with the pre-processor and have headaches ;)</p>

<p>However, no doubt that for somebody with formation to pbxes routing/ nbr processing it will be more natural to pre-process number and have linear approach. As it could be addressed by a dedicated plugin to csipsimple and would not IMHO be an approach to give to mainstream users.</p>

<p>Also, just some point about your latest statement. Actually if there is one activated account with a force rule that applies... no need of any other rule in other accounts ;). 
So actually in case you describe you only need ONE rule in the account you want to handle the matching numbers (depending on other filters you have this rule may be more complex but since rules supports regexp, everything is possible). 
Another point, if only one account remains as eligible for the number at the end of the processing it will be automatically used.</p></markdown-widget>

              are not stored in wiki/markdown or HTML format. So we probably need to

You asked me what's my way to do it and my feeling was, it is only one more entry above other accounts in the filter menu, why not? :O Leave the entry empty, the phone works in its old fashion. Filling it with pre-routing rules, some users may like its no brain dialing. For me, prefix is only used to forcibly select a specific provider for testing purpose. In most common cases, whether a number is 911, 611, +xxxxxxxxxxx, 011xxxxxxxxxxx, 00xxxxxxxxxxx, +1xxxxxxxxxx, 1xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, 0xxxxxxxxxx, 6, 7, 8, 8yyxxxxxxx, etc. etc. you don't need to teach the old parents, the wife and the kids how to use it. Just dial and talk. </p>

<p>But I guess most users have only one or two providers. As I said, it is good enough with the current implementation. Actually, I would say, it is an overkill. :O</p></markdown-widget>
