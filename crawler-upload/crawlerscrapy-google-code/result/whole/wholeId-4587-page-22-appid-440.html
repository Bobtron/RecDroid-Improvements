<p>Since it is from the android system that's really strange.
Is there an handset (Bluetooth / Headset) wired on your phone? </p>

<p>I'll try to read a little bit more the android source code to see why we get this log from the android audio stack.
Next Monday, I'll ask a colleague if I can test on his Desire 2.1. (It's an European version of the ROM but should behaves the same).</p>

<p>If I see something in the android code that there is something that could be interesting to test before Monday, I'll ask you on this thread.</p>

Most of the time in such case, can be due to the fact something in the SIP configuration doesn't allow to pass through the NAT of your 3G carrier.
Have you a stun server configured? In many case it can help with this kind of issues. </p>

<p>To enable stun server : Settings &gt; Media settings &gt; Tick enable stun and fill stun server with a stun server. If your sip provider has a stun server use it, else you can try stun.ekiga.net for example.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Well stay tuned on the dev on csipsimple. As I don't reproduce your issue, it's hard to tell when I'll be able to solve it. But with chance, as CSipSimple is opensource, maybe in the future it will really improves (and remember, CSipSimple is still in its alpha phase ;) )</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Could you try to follow the instructions and say me if it helps. On Desire quietly sure that's the problem : 3cx automatically add their stun server stun.3cx.com to get ride of NAT issues. As CSipSimple is not linked to any provider, I don't add a STUN server by default. I don't know the term of use of each stun providers so that I could use by default one stun service in csipsimple.</p>

<p>On LG : not sure that could solve the issue, if you constantly use the same connection, the problem is maybe somewhere else (but worth to try stun). So davidpnew if you reproduce with stun enabled, could you open another bug for LG GW620 support?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>However if you get absolutely no voice both way, that's probably something else than just a network traversal issue : 
Could you try when you reproduce the issue to toggle hold off and on again and say me if it helps? 
Some users has the same kind of issue (with desire) and reported me that holding and taking back makes things better.
If so I could probably try something (reverting a hack I did for Samsung Galaxy S support but done for all device since in theory it has no impact... but worth to try to do it <em>only</em> for galaxy S). </p></markdown-widget>

<p>I tried in 0.00-14 to activate by default STUN, but for many users it prevent from registering... so I reverted in 0.00-15 to default STUN disabled. </p>

<p>However I'd like to find a way to inform users that if they are experimenting one way audio issue, it's probably due to the lack of a STUN server behind a NATed network.
I've already written something in the FAQ, but not easy to access for users when they are in the app... 
I'll probably do something within the app or add a webview in the app that display the wiki FAQ (or just a link).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>If you succeed in making it working could you share the configuration you used on the issue 296? I'll try to add a wizard for this provider that automatically fill fields. But as far as I understood denghj you succeeded in making it working activating stun, however edwin doesn't succeed even if he activates STUN. If enciso could try with stun and give us feedback too could be nice ;) Thanks in advance all !</p></markdown-widget>
