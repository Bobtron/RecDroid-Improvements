<p>There is already something planned for this feature.
You can read my comment here : 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=41&amp;can=1#c1">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=41&amp;can=1#c1</a>
to see what is in my mind for now.
It fits your request and can also support more complicated configurations but can
evolves in the future.</p>

<p>I'll try to find something ergonomic for the user interface. I want to do something
powerful for users how wants to tweak anything but also something clear and simple
for the 80% users who just want something like you described.</p>

<p>So stay tuned : this feature is planned before the beta (so it's a priority). 
The next alpha release (0.00-12) will fix issues for some devices (critical sound
problems) and introduce call logs. But after this one, I'll start something on this
specific point.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The native library is more robust but there is maybe still issues after the first call.

<p>Many thanks in advance : it's important to me to be compatible with the most devices

<p>A first thing, not related to the bug but that you should know : 
I think that "advancedtaskkillerpro" kill my app using a not clean method and it make
it crashes since I use some native primitives. 
So it tries indefinitely to be restarted by android. You can try to ignore csipsimple
in the auto-kill list if advancedtaskkillerpro allow it. 
You'll probably save battery by ignoring it : when csipsimple manage alone its own
process it stops itself when it is not necessary anymore (it is not yet totally clean
but should be the case when in a stable version).
Besides I think that my app is not alone on your phone with this problem :
.batterymanager.PowerProfileSvc 
.friendfeed/.widget.SocialWidgetProvider$WidgetService
.blur.home.message/.MessageWidgetProvider$WidgetService
.blur.contacts/.CacheService 
.blur.home.status/.StatusWidgetProvider$WidgetService 
.blur.weather/.WeatherWidgetProvider$WidgetService 
.blur.weather/.service.WeatherService
are probably also impacted.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I think that the problem you encounter with audio is not linked to this
previous note. 
It look likes things I reproduced on colleagues phones : xperia x10 and samsung
galaxy and thanks to the traces you provides me, I think that I have a little idea
where the problem is now. So many thanks for your test.</p>

<p>@Gianluca &amp; @esteban :
I've just solved the issue with the incoming interface that appears while outgoing :
it was corrected once but regressed with the calllogs integration ;). 
I'll provide you a new build in this thread when i'll produce something to fix the
issue on the Motorola Backflip.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Many thanks for all your tests. Another build has been done with the help of two colleagues with their sony X10 and their Samsung Galaxy how reproduced some audio issues.
I built something that solve the issue for their devices. I'm not sure it will fix for the backflip but worth to test.
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=49#c1">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/issues/detail?id=49#c1</a>
You can test this new build. It is not the cleanest way to handle this issue, but should fix things.</p>

<p>@esteban : Actually, the Android calllogs and the csipsimple calllogs are not in the same database. I can implement something that synchronize the two databases. Good idea.
For the battery, there is many way to tweak csipsimple right now in order to save battery. You can for example choose to use it only for outgoing calls, or also choose to don't lock wifi. 
Indeed, I didn't really optimize things for battery savings yet. Especially when always active. But will be done soon once every audio issues will be fixed.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>For your first point it's a wanted differentiation (in order to quickly know whether it is a sip call). Besides, other icons are not really native icons : it's icons grabbed from the official android git repository. 
The difference is that if manufacturer or rom is customized, resources from csipsimple will be different from those of the phone. It's the best comprise to get something nice and something portable without using private "APIs".</p>

<p>For your second point, it's possible that csipsimple fight against a auto task killer. I repeat and insist, autotask killer on android is a very bad idea ! 
To convice you, an article I found yesterday following the official twitter dev account : <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/cwhm6/i_stopped_using_a_task_killer_last_week_to_see_if/">http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/cwhm6/i_stopped_using_a_task_killer_last_week_to_see_if/</a>
It clearly explain why task killer apps (and auto-task killer as consequence) drain the battery more than it save battery !!! (All the more so as using a nexus one which has a lot of RAM available).
Though, I would be really interested if you can get the logcat from your phone just before the battery draining. An error in csipsimple can't be exclude so worth to be checked !</p></markdown-widget>
