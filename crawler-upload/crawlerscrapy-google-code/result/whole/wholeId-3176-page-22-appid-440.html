                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Point #1 =&gt; Already the case for concurrent calls.</p>

<p>Point #2 =&gt; It's based on the default value of android telephony app and android telephony app doesn't have such an option. Do you think this is absolutely necessary to have this as option? </p>

<p>Point #3 =&gt; User interface is based on ICS stock call log app. So to keep consistency with stock app. As less thing as possible should be changed for design or ergonomic rule. I don't not pretend being better in design than google ergonomic designers. Do you? So we should follow their guidelines.</p>

<p>For all these points, if you really have specific needs on sip call logs, you can use a third party application to display calls logs. Even an app that allows to display stock calls logs could do the trick since csipsimple is integrated to sip calls logs. Such an app could be adapted to read in csipsimple calls logs (since there is an api for that). This is not needed as part of the mainstream app.</p>

<p>So I close this issue as not relevant of the core sip application but that could be taken into account in a third party app. 
The only point that could make sense in csipsimple is an option to setup max number of saved logs, even if I don't really see the use case :  It's currently 500, and I don't know anybody that will have enough time to study 500 of his own call logs. (unless it's searchable and synchronized in cloud... but this is, again, something that should be done by a third party application).
Android spirit, is that each app should focus on one thing that it does correctly. That's why I refuse anything that could be separated as an other application since it only benefit a few percentage of users. 
All your recent feature request are about doing a <em>very</em> complex application inside ONE application. I think that it is a very bad approach. Modularity is veyr important, and CSipSimple is not an OS inside the OS. It should talk with other application and benefit of other application and don't pretend doing things betters than other dedicated applications.
If each app follows that and correctly use api approach of android, user experience will be very good and all features can be addressed. Sometimes in separate apps, but since it's for separate needs, it makes sense.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>If I call a number 1234 5 times it should show 
1234 (5) and if click on it then it expands them (interleaving with
other calls if sorted by time in case there were other calls in betwen
