<p>There is some possible workaround that could make change the RFC compliant behavior of pjsip (the sip stack csipsimple is relying on). But it requires development on my side. As the "bug" is not on my side it would be better to fix pbxes.org server behavior (all the more so as if they fix that they will not be compliant only with csipsimple but with all SIP client that follow strictly the SIP standard).</p>

<p>If they don't fix and if I have time to dive in pjsip code to find a clean workaround that will not break things with other SIP server that follow SIP standard, I'll do but that's not a priority for me.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi r3gis.3R. I understand your frustration - the problem lies with pbxes.org's non-compliant behavior, not with csipsimple.</p>

<p>However, for a number of people (such as myself) TCP is virtually a requirement as our wireless provider deletes UDP NAT table entries very quickly (I'm with Telus, and I think I required a UDP keep-alive interval of 15 seconds). This has a major negative effect on battery consumption (and also bandwidth use to some extent), so TCP is the only practical option. And, for better or for worse, pbxes.org is the only free solution for SIP TCP (voxalot charges a fee, although small). </p>

<p>So, when you say don't use TCP with pbxes.org, what you're in effect saying to at least some people (those who can't use UDP for reasons above, and either can't or won't pay for a voxalot account) is that they cannot use csipsimple.</p>

<p>Note that I'm NOT criticizing your position - pbxes.org is the problem here, not csipsimple. But, just pointing out that if TCP and pbxes.org is not possible with csipsimple, then the only alternative for at least some people is to not use csipsimple.</p>

<p>On a side note, can you tell me if you folks have done any testing with csipsimple and TCP with FreeSWITCH? I gave it a try using FS on a home machine and ran into problems (as a comparison, sipdroid was fine). So, I'm wondering if you can tell whether it should work. Thanks.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Indeed, for those who wants to use pbxes.org I'd advise you to use sipdroid which is developed by pbxes.org guys. 
It's also an opensource app so that's fine ;). 
You can also try the excellent linphone which behaves differently with TCP and as consequence should probably pass the problem with pbxes.org.</p>

<p>I develop just for my pleasure. I have absolutely no commercial goal. If developping csipsimple become a constraint for me I'll stop. However keep in mind... that's opensource !!!! !!! :) If anybody wants to make a workaround for pbxes.org (that will not break pjsip compliance with the rest of the world ;) )... he will be welcome !! </p>

<p>I do not tell anybody "use my app it's the best". First cause I hope that's not "my" app but the app of "users", and then cause I truly believe in opensource and with the fact choice is really important. CSipSimple is just one of possible choice.
I really have the same approach than firefox has with the web. They make an open app to improve the open web !</p></markdown-widget>

Recently after all pain with tcp of pbxes.org I registered account with sipgate.co.uk. I use the latest market version and the default setting for sipgate. Because of my network (problems with NAT and UDP, works fine with TCP). It happens the following. I ring the test number 10000. I can hear the machine talking. I press the hang-up button. The voice immediately disappears but csipsimple says it is still connected. After a few seconds it hangs-up. In my opinion this is due to one-way connection. The csipsimple send hang-up code and the server hangs-up but it does not receive any confirmation of that so it does not show the line is closed.
When somebody calls me on sipgate. I can answer but unfortunately it is one way audio again. This time I do not hear nothing but the other side can hear me.
I do not know if I'm right but I can say it is working fine at home where I do not have any problems with the connection both on TCP and UDP.
I also do not know if there is any connection between this particular NAT issue and the problem with pbxes.org. Just decided to share the information.
Cheers.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I have an enormous amount of admiration for you and your efforts with csipsimple.  I've tried all of the other Android SIP clients and this one is by far the best.  Best audio quality, best interface, most options.  Sipdroid doesn't have G729 codec, either.  G729 works with my PBXes outgoing, but not incoming using Google Voice trunk, btw.  Not sure why not both.</p>

<p>Keep up the great work.  You are much appreciated.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>@Jim : I think that as soon as the old UDP registration will expire your tcp configuration (which is absolutely correct to do tcp, that's what tcp option implicitly do), will fall in the hang-up problem again.
That's cause when there is an udp registration active, pbxes.org accept the response that it actually ask to be done over udp. When only one tcp registration is active on their server, in one response they ask the sip client to use a route that does not use TCP (so by default it should be UDP), but ignore requests done over udp.</p>

<p>Unless they fixed things meanwhile??? would be great... 
Just to give some hope else to listeners of this thread, I've started yesterday a module to force tcp even if sip server actually ask udp. No target date for that, I do it only when I've some really free time to spend or want to code in C instead of java ;).</p></markdown-widget>
