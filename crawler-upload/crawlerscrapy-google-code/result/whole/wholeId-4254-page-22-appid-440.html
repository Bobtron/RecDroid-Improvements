                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Configure the application for STUN resolution
2. Kill it completely with task killer to assure service it killed
3. Cold-start the application, see it immediately register with SIP switch
4. Go into menu/settings/filters, select an account
5. Exit all the way back to main screen</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>Expected: Re-register (SIP account briefly disappears then re-appears)
Saw: SIP account disappears, followed by a series of toasts about STUN failures. Occasionally it will successfully re-register after one or two STUN faillures, but usually it simply fails to re-register, leaving only the Mobile icon. </p>

<p><b>Please use labels and text to provide additional information.</b></p>

<p>This only happens some of the time, maybe 30%. When it DOES happen, in order to get the phone to work I must kill it completely and fresh start it. This never happens on a fresh start; the STUN immediately resolves and the SIP account registers. Thus, my STUN server/port is correct and the STUN server is really working. </p>

<p>The fact that it only happens some of the time, and never on a cold start, makes this defect report suspicious. Anyway I thought I would report it.</p></markdown-widget>

It doesn't matter where in Settings you are, it is how long you stay in Settings. If you stay in a settings screen "too long" then when you come back out, the STUN fails to resolve. I looked at the code and the high-level STUN usage is quite simple, just configuring a non-zero number of stun servers, and filling in the host/IP for each. </p>

<p>This looks like a pjsip problem, and I am not knowledgeable in that area. I'm guessing that something must need to be done during pjsua.csipsimple_destroy() for the stack, or there is a bug in the stack when it is re-initialized or ??? </p>

<p>After investigation :
 * I fixed one thing that produced this error each time there is an incoming call. It should be included in latest build. (I made a mistake when including zrtp lib and it broke restart).</p>

<ul>
<li>Now I observe some other problem. It happens when STUN (without ICE) is used. In this case, after 2 restart of the stack (for example if you go in setting and press back), it break the stun resolution which block registration. I have no idea why yet. The only thing I can say is that activating ICE (which result in using another stun implementation of pjsip) solve the problem. I think there is something wrong in the old STUN method of pjsip. (and this old method is the one used when not activating ICE).
So, if you have the problem, you can simply activate ICE and use latest dev version so that you'll not experiment stun errors anymore.
But I'd like to understand why the old pjsip stun implementation fails when restarting the stack. There is maybe something they forgot to stop cleanly.</li>

<p>As workaround I think that activating ICE will help (at least on my side when I activate it problems disappear). As ICE covers all features of STUN + better features that's not a so bad workaround ;).</p></markdown-widget>
