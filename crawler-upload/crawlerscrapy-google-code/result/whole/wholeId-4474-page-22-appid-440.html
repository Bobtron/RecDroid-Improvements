2. Talk</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expected perfect audio in both directions. Result: Recipient hears a steady stream of popping noises, no popping noises heard by call initiator.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Both CSipSimple_0.00-15 and  CSipSimple_0.00-15-10 are afected
Samsung Galaxy S, Stock Froyo, UK version XXJPO</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
If, on the other hand, the Recipient in the above scenario initiates the call to the Android device, there is no popping at all in either voice direction.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>I have tested the revision 427 more extensively on WiFi now. The change to the audio software has definitely much improved things, but the problem has not completely gone away.</p>

<p>In CSipSimple_0.00-15-10 and earlier Market versions, the popping would most often occur as follows: normal audio for 5-10 sec, followed by a rapid sequence of 4-8 pops, followed by normal audio for 5-10 sec and then rapid pops again. The pops (as heard by the recipient of the call seem to be worse (or be triggered by) when the persion initiating the call (me with the Galaxy S and CSIPSimple) is talking - ie CSIPSimple is having to packetise audio.</p>

<p>In revision 427 the big improvement is that the pops occur much less frequently - only about once every 45 - 60 seconds, but the basic phenomenon is the same:  normal audio for 45-60 sec, rapid sequence of pops, ... repeated.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this primarily occurs when the call is pure VoIP - VoIP, within the domain of one VoIP provider.</p>

<p>When the call is VoIP - PSTN, the effect is mitigated somewhat by the way the media gateway between the VoIP domain and the PSTN behaves. This appears to be different to the way two SIP mobiles interact. Instead of hearing popping sounds, the call recipient hears media interruptions every 45-60 seconds which is much less distracting. When the initiator is not actually talking, the call recipient does not hear the media interruptions at all. All in all it leads to a much better experience as the recipient doesnt notice the problem nearly as much. My guess is that the underlying fundamental problem is still there.</p>

<p>My guess is that packets (or buffers?) are getting lost from the CSIPSimple packetisation somewhere and that this is causing the popping sound (or media interuption). I can exclude internet connectivity problems, because if I use two Nokia E90s (with built in SIP stack) at both ends of the call, using the same ISPs, there is no popping or media interruption. The call is as clear as normal PSTN.</p>

<p>I have tried using both default 16khz and 8khz sampling. This does not have any effect on the popping issue. As you say, the 16khz sampling leads to a slightly better voice quality for the call recipient.</p>

<p>Hope that this helps to track down hte issue further.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Well as for the background CPU usage I detected that on the Galaxy S I have now too. It's probably some weird implementation in the usleep on some android devices.
I've changed something available in revision 470 (<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a>) that decrease this background usage on galaxy S.</p>

<p>However it will probably not help regarding the popping sound.
I don't reproduce that on my phone, but under some conditions I can trust there is something that can go wrong : regarding the implementation of Samsung it behaves a really strange way sometimes.</p></markdown-widget>
