<p>It sounds like something with the location of the sdcard that changed.</p>

<p>Do you have the same problem when using "Backup/restore" feature (go in accounts view and press menu to use backup/restore). it stores a json config file in sdcard/CSipSimple/config folder if works. It will be interesting to test that because :
 * will eliminate it's not something with recording feature itself if the config folder with backup files is not found on your sdcard too.
 * will allow to see if the app by itself is able to retrieve saved config file while you don't see it browsing the sdcard (in this case would mean that the sdcard location has moved in 4.0.3 -- maybe 2 sdcard locations like one internal and one external or something like that).</p>

<p>Also doing the tests be sure the phone is not plugged with the usb cable. On some device simple fact it's plugged with usb cable unmount the sdcard and make it not available for writing.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, good, so it explains the problem :)</p>

<p>I basically use this method :
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html#getExternalStorageDirectory%28%29">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html#getExternalStorageDirectory%28%29</a>
to retrieve the folder where to store. </p>

<p>I guess that the Huawei update to 4.0 changed the return of this method to the "internal" sdcard. Which is maybe not a good idea from user experience point of view. (as described by google doc the folder returned here should be : &lt;&gt;)</p>

<p>So I would say that if it's hard to access this folder for you on the Huawai, I think it's a problem on the new Huawai ROM.</p>

<p>On my side the way to address this issue would be to have another application dedicated to "call record" management.
There is already the API for that in csipsimple and any developer can already start developing a dedicated app for managing "call records". But sounds I'll have to do that too ;)</p>

<p>Ideas of such an app would be to allow to compress (using better format than wav), rename, and organize call records by different ways than the default app and play these files (and maybe edit these files and send too).</p>

<p>Inside CSipSimple, I want to keep the feature simple and allow one (/several) third party application to manage these wav files. I want to provide an extensible API for dedicated apps and have just SIP features (or features that couldn't be done outside of the app).</p></markdown-widget>

Very interesting for me to know some ROM has such a setting :). I didn't knew.</p>

<p>About having csipsimple on sdcard, you're right better to keep it on internal SD card. 
Some users reported problems when moving it on SDcard. (Often with the right of the app to use network). 
I have explicitly allowed the app to be installed on sdcard, but I usually advise to not move it. 
It suitable only in case you use it very rarely and don't care about reliability. That's the case of some users and that's why I leave the choice :).</p>

<p>BTW, about this topic, some more information you might be interested in:
You can probably contact developers of apps that don't move to sdcard. 
It particularly makes sense if games. So you can ask them to add :
android:installLocation="auto" in their manifest. 
By default, if this is not added, the application is forced to be installed to sdcard (and only way, as you said, is to root the phone). 
I don't think it's a change in ICS however; was probably also the case previously ;).
But, some developers may have real reason for not allowing that : 
There is a list of case provided by google that tell us when we should or not allow moving to sdcard :
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/install-location.html#ShouldNot">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/install-location.html#ShouldNot</a>
It's developers webpage, but as user can be interesting to read too :)</p></markdown-widget>
