                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1.Register via SIP TCP (perhaps to gateway like FreeSWITCH)
2.Kill the server (server software is killed), resulting in the TCP connection being closed
3.Immediately restart the server
4.Wait</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<p>The expected result is that CSS should detect the loss of the TCP connection and attempt to register again.
The observed result is that CSS will not attempt to register until the EXPIRES timer goes off (i.e., when it is next scheduled to register)</p>

<p>Because of this, incoming calls are not received until a potentially long time after the server restarts (since there is no longer a TCP connection).</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<p>0.02-03 r944 (last GA build).
Debian 6.0.3 (Squeeze) with backports.</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>This happens despite CSS being configured to send Keep-Alives at in interval much smaller than the registration interval.</p>

<p>My setup:
CSS configured to use TCP.
CSS with registration interval of 60 minutes, and KA interval of 10 minutes. 
Using TCP-UDP gateway (similar in concept to using FreeSWITCH).</p>

<p>I start CSS and watch it register. 
I kill the gateway process and restart it.
I observe CSS not attempt to register until almost 60 minutes have passed.</p>

<p>The issue appears to be that the loss of TCP connection by the stack is not being communicated to CSS. Under the situation outlined above, the stack would immediately know that the TCP connection was lost (it should be pending on a read()/recv() or select()). Additionally, any attempt to send a KA would result in a SIGPIPE or a write error if SIGPIPEs were being blocked, so the stack would also eventually know from that way (if it was somehow ignoring closing of the connection).</p>

<p>The end result of this is that it is not possible to receive incoming calls until the next scheduled registration, which can be a very long time (60 minutes in my case).</p>

<p>What I believe is the correct behaviour is that CSS is notified as soon as the loss of TCP connection is detected (either by EOF on a read, or SIGPIPE on a KA write), and CSS then attempts to reconnect and re-register.</p>

<p>Note that if the server goes down in a "hard" manner (e.g. someone pulls the power plug on it) loss of connection will NOT be immediately detected and it would be up to the KA to determine loss of connection (a SIGPIPE being generated after TCP does a number of retries while waiting in vain for a TCP ACK).</p>

<p>Would really appreciate if you could have a look at this.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time and the amazing effort you've put into this very, very good SIP client.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>It ~should~ work the way you expect. 
First of all, about timers, you should try a latest nightly build it should be better regarding timers and keep alive.</p>

<p>Then about the point you raise. pjsip sip stack should normally behaves this way. Actually it is even hidden to the application that the connection were cut and everything should be managed on the sip stack level. Eventually the sip stack will raise some info about the registration state to the application side if the udp ka can't be sent or if tcp stream were closed for any reason.</p>

<p>However, what can happens, and what I observed on 100% of 3G network I tested on (and on some wifi networks too), is that there is some network equipement that does not handle very well connections status. 
Let me explain a very "normal" use case on 3G I've unit tested and I'm sure about. When you leave a TCP socket without any activity for some time you are then in a state where the TCP ack are not transmitted from server to the client. We can easily see that by wiresharking client and server. Server send tcp hack and receive an error about this ack and client never receive anything. So client think it is still connected.
This time may vary from a carrier to another. For example some french carrier here reach this state after 1h30. A labs with femtos we have reach this state after 5min. It seems to depends on core network configuration and is not very predictable.</p>

<p>So could be in your case due to this kind of problem. If so nothing can really be done on client side to get the info cause the info about the cut of the tcp stream is never received.
So to be sure you are not in this case, it could be interesting if you can do tcpdump at least on server side (or the last thing that hold the tcp stream with the client), to confirm that the tcp end is acknowledged by the client. A tcpdump on the client could be interesting too (but if your nexus s is not rooted with a rom that allows that, you may not have this possibility).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I've repeated the test while running tcpdump like you suggested. When I kill the gateway process I see 2 FIN,ACK TCP segments go from the server to mobile, and then one FIN segment from the mobile to server. So the mobile's kernel is definitely seeing the TCP close. OTOH, still don't know what the pjsip SIP stack is doing as a result of this.</p>

<p>Any suggestions as to how I can determine what pjsip is doing? Also, any pointers to where in the source code (CSS or pjsip) I could look?</p>

<p>FWIW, I think the situation you describe above about lack of mobile response due to TCP inactivity is caused by the TCP connection's NAT entry being timed out. I know this isn't my case as, under normal conditions, I can see CSS keep-alives come in every 10 minutes even though no other activity is going on. I've also got TCP-level keep-alives going on the gateway side with a 15 minute interval.</p>

<p>I have not tried latest nightly yet.</p></markdown-widget>
