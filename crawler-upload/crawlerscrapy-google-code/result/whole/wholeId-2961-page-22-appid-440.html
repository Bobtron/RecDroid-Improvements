<p>As I said before to you by email, the CSIMPLE SIP phone is a great application, really.</p>

<p>The only thing that is becoming a must is the file format of the recorded calls. Look, I make everyday calls to my partners in Europe and then I share these conversations with my business partners by email.
The problem is that each recorded file has 5 - 14 and up to 18 Megabytes size. So to upload to the mail and send it is a pain in the ass. Sorry for my words but it is the reality.</p>

<p>If you are able to make the record files in a lower size, that will be fantastic. I use another call recorder when I call local phones and it record in 3gp file format and for the same conversation time it is 15 or 20 times less size.</p>

<p>This will be a great enhancement.</p>

<p>Thanks Regis.</p>

<p>regards, Victor</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>As replied in private email. The position on this topic is to make a dedicated different app for that.</p>

<p>There is EVERYTHING necessary in CSipSimple api to do that. Issue 1839 definitely fix the needed things for a third party application to treat on the fly the recorded entry.</p>

<p>For the record, and for others that wonder about that, some hints about the topic to understand why it's recorded under wav format and why it should be treaten by a third party application dedicated to format conversion. (Thanks to the intent of issue 1839 it could be done AUTOMATICALLY by such a third party app).</p>

<p>Things to consider :
 - If I record under 3gp format (which use AMR codec), it would mean extra CPU cycle to encode the PCM frames to AMR. While encoding into wav PCM is costless (since it's already the format the sound is played and recorded). So it's not good to record in real time to a different format than wav because would affect call quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>It could be done once the call is ended (or record is stopped).
But I don't think it's a good idea to integrate this feature directly inside CSipSimple itself. The android platform is well designed enough to allow application to talk with each others. Besides developping CSipSimple I keep that in mind and provide a way to third party applications (with correct permissions granted at install time) to do extra things.
As I also believe in the fact an application should focus one thing but do it completely and cleanly... I think that to address your need it would be way better to do a "plugin" or third party application. Dedicated to call records management.
Not only it could give a way to encode file into a lighter format for storage once conversation is ended; but it would also allow to rename files with your own rules, to play, to share recorded conversations etc etc. Everything in mind of users could take place in such a dedicated application. While in csipsimple it could remain very simple and focused on SIP feature.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to keep things rudimentary inside CSipSimple to allow another (or many others) apps to manage that cleanly and fully.
If I have time, I'll do such an application. That's in my todo list with a low priority. But as CSipSimple is opensource and free as in speech any developer that would like to contribute such an extra application would be welcome and I will help this kind of initiative.</p>

<p>I hope you understand my position. And if you are a developer and would like to take the point and develop such an app, don't hesitate to tell; I'll give you starting entry points to do that ;).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I just saw that the recording file from a call, is recorded at 256 Kbps so that's why this resultant file is so heavy in MB and consume more processor.</p>

<p>But this is only a phone call, not a high definition music, so a solution to not have big files, is to decrease the recording file to 96 Kbps.</p>

<p>So the resultant file will be 1/3 heavy and will consume less processor.</p>

<p>I guess is a very good idea as an enhancement.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi Victor,
Indeed it's 256 Kbps and it's made to minimize CPU process and re-sampling.</p>

<p>I guess that your clock rate setting is 16kHz (the default).</p>

<p>So you have 16kHz x mono (1 channel) x 16 world length =&gt; 256 kbps.
Logic :) !</p>

<p>Again, that's to reduce the CPU cycle ! No resampling here ! It just take what is played. 
You could change audio clock rate to 8kHz if you want. It will change bitrate of wave file to 128kHz and may avoid some resampling between audio codec and audio device. However perceived quality will probably be lower ;).</p>

<p>The current record method is made to avoid any extra CPU cycle. It just write to wav file the same thing that it write to audio device.
And again, to reduce the file size, the correct solution is to resample/convert/compress the file once the call is ENDED. Everything in CSipSimple api is ready to do that... it just needs a third party application to do that ;)... and do that good ! with all options !</p></markdown-widget>
