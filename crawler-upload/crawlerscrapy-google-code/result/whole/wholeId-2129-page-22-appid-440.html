1. Reference is made to item 2500.
I'm entered proxy (02-server)and realm (nsn.com), registrar same as proxy
used port is 5061 (sips)
2. After dialing a telephne number the history show 123456@proxy
3. 403 forbidden is shown</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Client should use realm (nsn.com) instead of the proxy entered values or it should made configurable. Normal SIP servers are set-up to use always the realm.</p>

<p>P.S. : for short term, as a workaround, csipsimple allows you to specify for each call the target domain. To do so:
go in "txt" dialer mode (press txt button on dialer screen) and enter the @nsn.com at the end.</p></markdown-widget>

It's more logical regarding what I expected at the time of coding : I was considering that you'd like to contact somebody on same domain than the one you register to.</p>

<p>However, using AoR (sip id) domain as very first choice would be even better : rather than using the sip server user register to, it will use id the user register as.
I still consider that realm is not a valid option as linked to credentials. To get convinced : you might have several credentials in sip, even multiple layer of credentials that would lead to multiple realm -- for example it's theoretically possible to have one challenge from the proxy with one realm, and one challenge from the registrar with another realm. It never happened in current real deployment I found -- and that's why csipsimple allows you to enter only one credential and realm for now; but it's possible in SIP protocol and might be allowed in csipsimple in the future if somebody needs it. That's why I consider this as a non valid solution, but if you have good reason why you thought I'm wrong, please tell. I'm not totally sure of what should be the good one : normally, just like with email, SIP users should normally always enter a domain in the address they call. The way we dial in phone dialers, is more something that was standardized in SIP later as the "tel:" scheme. BTW, the best geek solution would be to have a dedicated option as you suggested to set the default call domain. But that would be only something available in expert mode and few mainstream users will care about it. So I would rather try to find the best "default" domain and then, if still necessary to add some extra option for very special cases, lets add it. But if we succeed in something that pleased everybody automatically, it's better ;)</p></markdown-widget>

What I'm doing is entering the 7 digits than I switch to text-mode to add @nsn.com.
This handling is not comfortable.
Even in multi-media domains realm is used. We have to use following settings:
SIP Account
-   Kontoname                NSN-VoIP
-   Konto ID                     disp-name <br>
-   Registrar                    sip:84.16.XXX.YYY <br>
SIP Autentication
-   Realm                         nsn.com <br>
-   Benutzername         first.family-name@nsn.com <br>
-   Passwort                    123456       - <br>
-   Data Type                  Klartextpasswort
-   Scheme                      Digest <br>

Proxy

<p>Your statement " choosing nsn.com as the default domain for this account. ... is translated by "Konto ID"" is not so clear to me. I have following inserted: "first-name" - as proposed - nsn.com is included.
I got my login data from our IT, which is now 2 y old.</p>

<p>Pls. note: this or other multi-tenant users / virtual- and normal operators will use REALM (as FQDN) for this - especially in deployments for &gt; billion subscribers. Even when using e.g. X-lite (called: domain) or other clients in our test-bed. Proposal "REALM=*" as using Proxy information is fair and OK. This will work on smart home (asterisks) and big telecom networks.
Reference is made to Issue 2500 - Bell in CA (which is a big operator) is also complaining regarding REALM. REALM is a very important parameter inside the set-up of internal IMS (CSCF) / soft switches (as FQDN).</p></markdown-widget>
