<p>Latest dev versions should be safe regarding this kind of crash. 
Previously dev &amp; production version where not compatible cause the native library were not put in the same directory. And then sometimes a production version tried to load a dev library or the dev version tried to load the market library which most of the time crash.</p>

<p>On many recent custom roms (based on cyanogen work), uninstalling an application doesn't erase its files and its settings which in my case is a very bad thing when you try to switch from dev to production or from production to dev. </p>

<p>So first thing you could try :
Install the latest dev version available on download section. Currently it's 0.00-15-10. 
The next release on the market will be more safe to switch between market and dev so, it will be fine upgrading for market after 0.00-16.</p>

<p>If it doesn't help, could you send me some logs? (Install for example LogCollector and try to start the app and directly after it crashes uses LogCollector to send me logs).</p></markdown-widget>

Well, here it's a problem with database upgrade. It tries to upgrade the database (there is some new fields in newer version, but it fails). 
In fact, it detect that the database is known in android with an old version so it tries to upgrade it... but it fails since the database is actually already up to date.</p>

<p>I'll do something to catch this exception and fail silently. 
But this behavior is a bug in the ROM. What I'll do to fix it is improve the robustness of the app, but this case should never happen.
And I think that other app could theoretically have this issue if they use the android database upgrade mechanism.</p></markdown-widget>

The interesting thing here is that I was getting the same crash results even after a complete wipe and reinstall of non-rooted stock 2.2.  Weird, but it appears this fixed the issue.  I was interested in this latest release as you integrate call transfers.  The reason I have been using 12.23 was because that was the only one I could get Bluetooth to work but I'm sure its working great now.  Thanks again :)</p>

<p>Follow up: The program was able to install w out crashing however, BT functionality is quite hampered and does not work consistently in this version.  I am using this with GV callback, and the answering when making an outbound call works inconsistently as well.  It appears that 12.23 is still the version that is working best for me.  I have attached log after experiencing these issues and it is attached. After experiencing decreased BT functionality and answering I went back to 12.23 and am now experiencing static when on calls with 12.23 so I am going to flash back to a previous state before I installed the 15.10 apk you linked for me above and hopefully I can go back to good call quality and BT functionality as well as excellent call answering capability, was just trying to add the call transfer function that you added.  Thanks for your efforts</p></markdown-widget>

I'd be really interested by your logs with -15-10 cause that's the current version and if there is a regression I could maybe fix it. Besides, it would be a shame if I left you with an old version which will not be maintained ;)</p>

<p>For BT just something important : now (in recent version) it doesn't automatically try to connect bluetooth since on some devices it introduced big problems with audio when no BT device were actually connected. 
If you are using an A2DP device you'll hear sound on the headset, but BT micro will not work and you'll have to manually activate BT toogle in the UI to be able to talk.
Also, you should use 8kHz audio instead of 16kHz with Bluetooth, that's more stable. 8kHZ was standard in older version but now it's 16kHz since quality is better on earpiece and speaker. You can easily switch back to 8kHz in settings &gt; media &gt; Frequency.</p>

<p>I'll try to solve that later, but that's maybe what you are experimenting (I mean it's maybe just something about application settings that are not tuned for your device/use case). 
If you set frequency to 8kHz and manually switch to Bluetooth is it better on -15-10?</p>

<p>For the fact that even after a complete wipe you get the issue, I guess there is something that put your apps and settings on the sdcard (app2sd?).</p></markdown-widget>

It rings then I go to the csip program then go back to answer the call and it I can answer it that way.

Well first analysis, (I forgot that but...) you are using 2.2 that has an big bug with bluetooth APIs.</p>

<p>They have fixed it in 2.2.1 . I don't know if the upgrade to 2.2.1 is available on droid yet. But if you're rooted and on a custom ROM, could be great if the rom have already an upgrade to 2.2.1 since AFAIK it's the only way to cleanly solve that : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9503">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9503</a>. </p>

<p>On nexus one the same error would have rebooted the phone automatically, but on your rom it fail silently (I guess they add something to avoid the fact that crash in core system reboot the entire system process)</p>

<p>What you have in -12-23 is probably a workaround I did that doesn't close the BT channel but when I tested was really unstable while in 2.2.1 and with my changes that cleanly close the BT channel things are more reliable.</p>

<p>If you want I can try to revert just this part (to keep the old unclean workaround) for you and provide you a custom build of the app to test.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, yeah I tried to use a different ROM this morning but it wouldn't interact and turn on BT at all when switched on the BT headset itself, I'm guessing it was not 2.2.1.  I was trying steel droid minimalist 1.3 and 1.4.  Most of the custom roms are built on froyo but looking this morning I didn't see any mention of the 2.2.1, so I'm guessing it was not.  If you can provide this work around I will test it for you.  It seems odd that 2.2 would have a major bluetooth bug, sad indeed.</p>
