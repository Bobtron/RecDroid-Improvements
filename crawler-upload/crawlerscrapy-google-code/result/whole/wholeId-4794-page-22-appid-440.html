1. calling from text dialer</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
The outgoing call is ok but on csipsimple I don't listen ringing</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
011 on HTC Legend 2.1</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
Great improvements in the new version.
For me is very usefull in the availability profile the option "Only for 
outgoing"
No more freeze but sometimes the app is slow closing a call</p>

<p>Thanks, great job</p></markdown-widget>

Once CSipSimple receive this response it starts ringing (I have to check but I think
it's the default behavior of the native stack pjsip on which csipsimple is based).</p>

<p>By the way, many sip client doesn't respond automatically with the ringing state
(that's also the case if there is no client registered to receive your call).</p>

<p>So can you precise the callee SIP client used and whether there is a client
registered on the other side?
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>P.S. : for the "Only for outgoing option", it was already present before but was less
clear (it was in Network section). In one of the next release, at the first
application start, (before the add account screen) the "Easy configuration" screen
will be shown. Then, it will be still possible to tweak it using Network&gt; Use WIFI/3G
for outgoing/incoming.</p></markdown-widget>

I tried to call the C450 IP using others windows sip client or my nokia e65, the

<p>Sometimes when I close a call, I think particularly when the call duration is longer

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>In your case I think that's more something linked to the provider as you said.
In fact, csipsimple automatically configure "proxy" for most sip accounts. 
It means that all sip invite will be transmitted to your smslisto server that should transmit the request to other servers (the one of the relevant domain in your sip address).
Sometimes, sip servers that are mainly registrar has really few features as proxy. Some does not transmit the Invite request that is not their own domain at all - in this case you can have a direct hangup-, others transmit but does not send the &lt; 200 states (ringing is a temporary state : 180) so that the client is not aware about what is happening on the other side.</p>

<p>So I think that in this case it's more about the fact the sip server of your provider does not proxy correctly. 
To solve that there is mainly two solutions :
 * The first one is to remove proxy field from configuration on this account. Sometimes it's not hurting but sometimes it lead to have calls going to this domain not working add all.
 * The second one is simply to create a "local account" using the local wizard, and when you want to make a call to another domain, to choose this local account instead of the account which aim is to gateway with the pstn network. In this case the local account will directly contact the server that is after the "@" add send an invite to this server. (Here this sip server have to allow other domains to call their sip clients but if it does things should go fine :) )</p></markdown-widget>
