<p>If there is a long list of items in CallLogs - it takes a long time to remove majority of them, while keeping some set of records untouched (for further references). The only option now is to go to every item, make a long tap and choose "Delete this call". Then go to next and repeat the same. And so on...</p>

<p>In Android OS there is a well known interface, that allows to put check marks to listed items and then user can perform action (in this case - delete) for all items in the group. It's easy and it takes considerably shorter time to get job done.</p>

<p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Try to remove a big group of items from the CallLogs list
2. Watch how long it will take...</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Marking multiple items from the list and then asking for action (delete)</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Latest v.02-03 from the Market. Android 2.1</p>

<p>Here is one way how you may want to do it:
1. When in call log tab, user may click on "Delete" (see Note below, p2) button from "Menu".</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><p>Call log tab comes into its "Selection" mode. In this mode new bar at the bottom appears (and stays, while tab is in this mode) and it contains 3 buttons: "Select all", "Delete", "Cancel". Because there is no item is selected yet, the "Delete" button is grayed.</p></li>
<li><p>User can click on "Select all" button and all items become highlighted (selected). Or he may tap specific item(s) one by one and by tapping them toggle its/their status (from un-selected to selected and vice versa). </p></li>
<li><p>At the moment when at least one item is selected the button "Select all" changes to "Invert". Pressing this button inverts selection of all items. If all items become unselected - it may change back to "Select all" (and "Delete" button becomes grayed again).</p></li>
<li><p>When user done with selection, he may press "Delete" button. It will delete all selected items at once.</p></li>
<li><p>Pressing on "Cancel" button at any time returns call log tab into its original mode without making any changes.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note:
1. Changing tabs (sliding to sides or clicking on tabs directly) doesn't change the mode of call log tab. Pressing on "Delete" or "Cancel" does (bottom bar disappears and no selection is allowed anymore).
2. You may change the name in menu from current "Delete all calls" to simply "Select". If you do so, you may use selection mode for more then just "Delete" action later on. For example, you may offer new function - "Save" (to save selected items) or other similar actions, applicable to a subset or items.
3. Example of similar additional menu bar containing controls (buttons, check boxes) you may find in "OS Monitor" application.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>What's a little bit surprising is that android guys only applies that to emails and not to stock call logs in android 4.0. 
That's the reason why it was not directly in the changes made, because I simply reused the source code of ICS for the new interface of call logs. 
I guess google engineers considers that as over engineering -- and also probably expect third party apps to allow such call log management. </p>

<p>Since in csipsimple there is no way (for now?) to have such third party apps to manage its call logs, your issue is still valid and will go in the good same way that the ICS redesign of the app. 
However not highest priority for now, I've still to put the priority list adapter back to retrieve same level of feature as previously. Then I'll have a look to new features. I would have preferred that this one has been automatically get from android ICS source code, but sounds I'll have to code it by my own ;).</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Just couple of points related to the issue:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm running 1 year old HTC Aria. And I don't think it will ever get Android 3, not to mention Android 4. It will be updated from v2.1 to 2.2 though, but perhaps that's it. So, waiting for Android to implement "Select" functionality is not an option for me, not at all.</p></li>
<li><p>The page linked in your post suggests to use long press gesture as a "Select" action. It's quite stupid, if you ask me... While it may work with one or two items, it's not suitable for any real work. Good luck selecting more than several items with that long press action. For example, my call log currently contains may be a hundred items or may be even more. If I'd need to select most of them (e.g. to delete) I spend all my day just making long taps on every item individually. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The proposed solution is: set "Select" mode and tap (note - a short tap, not long one) several items you want to keep (important calls only). Then press on "Invert" button and delete the inverted set. That's it. No long taps required and you cleaned up your long call list very fast.</p>

<p>I'm afraid that you'll have to code that by your own ;). Sorry to say that, but I need (and I suspect, I'm not the only one) to clean up my call log, while keeping important calls in the log safe. Especially in case, if I make a lot of test calls and call log becomes very big very fast... :) I'm sure you know what I mean here...</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>About point 1, that's not a problem. I can easily do backward compatibility.</p>

<p>About point 2, the link is the android design guidelines. So that the way things should be implemented by android application. They did big efforts to not see android developers reinventing the wheel for each feature.
Besides I think that you misunderstood the explaination they give. But since you never used an android 4.0 device it's quite normal :). 
Let me try to explain more in details what it's about.
The long press is something additional to the checkbox. In the link they talk about long press because that's what changed compared to previous version. 
It's still possible to add checkbox, and a single tap on checkbox just behaves as you described it. 
Their point is about the fact the long press does not anymore display a context dialog anymore but rather change in the action bar actions that could be performed on the selection. The checkbox is still an option to quickly select rows.
When in selection mode, there is obviously the delete button, but also other action that can be performed on the selection. If only one item is selected the action are the one there where previously on context dialog. If multiple there is all actions that can apply to multiple selection. We can also add an action "invert" in this case.</p>

<p>So don't be so worried, the fact that it comes from an android design guideline is a good point, android designers thought about usability of that. And besides, as they did this work I think that it's a good idea to follow their guidelines. My point was not about going against your description because it's almost the same thing that the one described by the link I gave. It's just about enrich the description and give me the ref to the more detailed and complete guideline of google designers. </p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>You're right. I have never seen Android v4 and, therefore, could misunderstood the new prospective feature. Thanks for explanation. And I agree with your point that it's better to follow standards then invent something special (in case if those standards allow the needed functionality, of course).</p>

<p>The feature to manage long list of calls (to remove many, while keeping some set of calls untouched) is quite hot. I see my log is growing bigger and bigger every day (especially if I do a lot of test calls). I don't want to remove all entries at once (as I can do it right now), because log keeps relatively small subset of calls (some are tricky test calls), that I'd like to keep for a while, but, at the same time, don't want to add them into my personal contact list. The feature becomes important, because I don't know a way to save URL from some records in the log to clipboard (or a file) now. </p>

<p>An ability to copy / paste full URL from logged calls would somehow mitigate the quite urgent need to manage (using select / invert actions) of the long list of logged calls. I'd copy those URL's into my notepad app, remove all calls from the log altogether and then I may to repeat the calls by copy / paste saved URL's/Numbers to dial pad of CSS. But so far, I don't know how to save URL from logged calls. </p>

<p>BTW, it could be a nice feature by itself (independently of removing calls) - to allow copy data from calls in history to clipboard (or may be a file). I guess it's easy to implement even now... What do you think?</p></markdown-widget>

The benefit allowing a third party app to do such import/export/treatment on call logs would be to allow third party apps to do more things. 
For example, there is a very cool app that I use to synchronize stock call logs to my gmail account (it also do for sms). Each time I get a call log it push it to some gmail label.</p>

<p>I think that it would be more valuable to spend time on allowing third party apps doing integration with csipsimple call log database (BTW, the interface will be almost the same than the stock call logs one) to allow apps that already allow to manage stock call logs to also manage csipsimple call logs.
I always resent doing specific not sip related things inside the app while the spirit of android is to have apps specialized in doing things to suit specific use case.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>As I said, it follows new ICS user interface guidelines.</p>

<p>Just long press a row, and you'll enter the "batch" mode. You can then simple click each row you want to delete by single clicking it. And finally choose the delete option in the bottom action bar.</p>

<p>The copy option will also land soon but I wonder if would not be more efficient to switch to text dialer with sip uri pre-filled - it will allow to copy/paste anyway and that would match the "Modify before dialing" option of the stock dialer.
I'm not fan of the idea to save a list of call logs (in file or clipboard) because it would mean to some not expected result. I mean some lambda user will not necessarily expect that it will export to plain text format with just uris. If there is a normalized format for call logs it could be interesting and clear for users (something like "Export these calls logs to format xxx"). But since there is not, it's probably better to leave a third party app to manage that kind of processing. While the "modify before call" remains in the same application and so make more sense as core feature.</p>

<p>This design pattern should also allow to do more batch actions on call logs items. But I have none in mind for now. If you have don't hesitate to ask :).</p>

<p>I'm also considering the "Select All"/"Invert" option but I have to check if possible using the compatibility library for action bar.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>First of all, thank you for implementing this useful feature!</p>

<p>At this point of time (since beginning of February I have a very large
amount of items in the log, may be a thousand records) the "Select
All"/"Invert" option would be the most desirable one. What I need is
to keep may be 20-30 records and the rest must be gone. And "Select
All"/"Invert" would help to do it very quickly.</p>

<p>Without that option I went to go through the list manually marking one
by one items in the list from the beginning. Marking worked fine. But
after marking a lot of items in the list (may be more then a hundred),
suddenly all list become unchecked... It happened at a routine mark of
a next item, nothing special at all. May be there is a limit of marked
items that program supports? Or perhaps, there is an other
explanation...</p>

<p>I tired to continue again from the beginning. But then, in a while,</p>

<h2>application crashed with this message box:</h2>

<p>Sorry!
The application CSipSimple (process com.csipsimple) has stopped
unexpectedly. Please try again.</p>

<h2>Force close</h2>

<p>It could be related or it could not (I've seen it time-to-time before
with the new GUI implementation).</p>

<p>After restarting the application, I' started the process again. But
now I mark no more then 100 items and delete them, repeating the whole
process again and again. The problems above (both sudden clearance of
the list and crash) have repeated itself after next several hundreds
of marked/deleted items...</p>

<p>BTW, with HTC Aria (screen 480x320) and the current width (height) of
every record in the log list I effectively can mark about only 3 items
per page and then I have move to the new page. Then mark next 3-4
items and move to the page further. You got the picture... I mention
about it because I value every pixel of vertical space in those
records. The less one item takes from the screen, the more items I can
see in one page (and mark) in call log. Please keep it in mind when
you design the layout.</p>

<p>Small notice. When I delete next 100 items by pressing on 'X' icon I
expect to continue to mark items in the list. What I'm getting is the
internal pointer (including pages) now points about 100 below the item
I checked last time. I guess some re-calculation of the pointer would
be useful here, so I may just continue marking process from the place
I left it (before pressing on 'X' icon).</p>

<p>Good. I need it to do a very simple task. If I have a record and I
need to make a small change in URI and make a new call, using changed
URI, I have to be able to <em>copy</em> the URI from that record into
clipboard. Then I can edit it in dialer as I need. But the problem is
- there is no way I can copy data (sometimes a long URI) from current
record in the log... That's what I'm missing now.</p>

<p>About copy / paste at once number of selected records from the log (as
a batch operation), I don't think we create an additional security
risk here. Android phones are inherently insecure. It's just a matter
of time for a person, who got the possession of your phone, to analyze
(and copy) all of your records there. There is no security or serious
privacy protection offered. On the other hand, this feature may create
additional convenience for legitimate phone user, who knows that he
can save important records from the list to clipboard for further use.
Export marked records with different formats (including text) sounds
like an interesting idea. But the plain text would be fine as first
option...</p>

<p>So, so far I see followed items for batch operations:
"Delete", "Mark All", "Invert", "Copy".
I guess someone else could contribute other ideas here :)</p>
