Everything was working great. I would dial a number in the stock dialer for Android (I have Gingerbread), and then I could choose between Sip2Sip, Skype, and my native mobile dialer.</p>

<p>Yesterday it was continuing to work great, and until I went to use it and it wasnt there. I had the option to choose between Skype and the mobile dialer, but no Sip2Sip. I checked the options in CSipSimple, and nothing had changed. The integration was still checked off. The WiFi options were still checked off (and I was connected to WiFi, and had perfect internet access). I even tried checking off EVERYTHING in the options to use CSipSimple with all types of networks (not just Wifi... 3G, GPRS, etc for both incoming and outgoing).</p>

<p>I uninstalled CSipSimple multiple times and re-set everything back up, and same thing. Only the option for Skype and the mobile dialer. I even used SD maids Corpse Finder to see if maybe CSipSimple was leaving bits behind after being uninstalled and it didnt. It was clear after uninstallation.</p>

<p>There was no update for CSipSimple so I don't know what would have changed. So I uninstalled it again, found an old apk of CSipSimple, and still no change. I still cant get the Sip2Sip option to pop up when I use my native dialer.</p>

<p>I am at a loss. Please help me!!! I don't understand why the option just magically disappeared!!!</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>It's weird that it worked previously if skype was there and if you never activated the "priviledged integration" in the warning tab.</p>

<p>So, lets try to reconfigure. 
Just a little point before. Skype use what's called the "priviledged" way to integrate the outgoing calls. This basically breaks the default integration of csipsimple (which is more clever as allow to only ask if network available for outgoing voip calls and if you didn't configure a filtering rule for the dialed number). But, well, as soon as you have skype it's broken and you have to configure csipsimple to use the same crappy way to integrate android system.</p>

<p>To do so:
Go in settings, press menu key, select "Expert mode".
Go in the "user interface" section of settings.
The two first option are about android stock dialer integration. 
The first one the clever integration. Leave it disabled.
The second is the privileged integration. If you want to have the app listed as an option in same level than skype, enable this option.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>What could have happened is that you activated the privileged integration in the warning tab once, and ignored the warning on the second installation. (normally the app detects if other apps integrates the privileged way and advise to use this way as well).</p>

<p>Then about the privileged integration, it's highly linked to apps installed. It's definitely a non user friendly way to integrate, but as soon as other apps installed on phone (such as skype) use this way, you'll have at choice :
 - to use this integration way for all apps.
 - keep csipsimple clever integration on, and choose stock dialer/GSM as the "remember my choice" (/always) option. The problem is that each time skype (or other app doing privileged integration) upgrades you'll have to choice again the mobile gsm as the "always" choice. (then behind you'll have csipsimple popup -- if necessary)</p></markdown-widget>
