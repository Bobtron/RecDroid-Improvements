<p>If so, there is a "bug" in the wifi driver of Nexus One and some HTC devices.
The issue 71 provides more details on this issue.</p>

<p>Due to this problem, if an application use WIFI to receive datas, when the screen goes off, the application doesn't receive datas in real time. As result you get a choppy sound.
The only work around is preventing screen going off. That's the reason why in latest version screen is lock at least in "DIM" mode (previously it was buggy but probably for you in full bright mode).
To prevent user from unwanted action I started by implementing an additional lock overlay. For now just based on a timer, but will be based on proximity sensor soon.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Though, issue accepted and reused for Proximity sensor implementation : 
It will not blank the screen but just activate/deactivate the double tap locker screen. 
Unless of course, the "keep awake while in call option" is disabled but <em>must</em> not be the case for HTC devices. And in this case, yes, it will blank the screen.</p></markdown-widget>

The issue can appear if you turn off the "keep awake while in call option" (User interface section not in the network section).</p>

<p>However you're probably right, not all HTC devices suffer of this issue. 
A good way to reproduce and be sure your device is or not affected is to turn the screen off (using the power button / quick press) while in call and see if the audio becomes choppy.</p>

<p>Btw, could be a good idea to set these option at first run according to the detected device. For now it seems to be confirmed only for the Nexus One and the Desire.
We should also make tests with codecs and audio driver frequency to see what are the best settings to set as default according to the device. (I mean if we should or not set 8Khz or 16Khz, if VAD and echo cancellation should be disabled, which codec should be disabled etc etc).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>When in a call the screen currently blanks as expected which is good, but then if I want to access the screen (to hangup the call for instance) the phone has locked the screen so I have to first press the power button for the screen to go back on then use the slider to unlock it before I get access to the call. Maybe not a big deal but a little annoying procedure.</p></markdown-widget>

But I've just seen that it prevent from keyguard mode only if already in keyguard mode.
Just to be sure, if you receive an incoming call while you are in keyguard mode (screen off), the screen should wake up and keyguard should be disabled. And then even if screen goes off keyguard will continue to be disabled.
The bug only appear if when call is started, keyguard is already not locked, isn't it?</p></markdown-widget>

But... not works as it works in the native phone app : (they use private API and besides they have no the issue with Nexus One wifi psp mode - which simplify their life)</p>

<p>For reference, here is how it is implemented :</p>

<ul>
<li>Case 1 : Device has a proximity sensor : 
When proximity sensor announce something is near of the phone, the lock overlay appear (full screen). When sensor announce nothing is near, lock overlay disappear.</li>
<li>Case 2 : Device has no proximty sensor :
After timeout (5sec the first time, 20sec if after a manual unlock), lock overlay is shown. Double tapping on it hide this overlay.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then....
* Case 1 : no "keep awake while in call" (hack for nexus one psp mode) :
Then phone will wait the time defined in settings and turn off the screen just as it normally does when no activity is detected on the screen. (Note : the goToSleep function defined in API is too dangerous to be use while in call to force screen off mode - and probably also break the wifi lock).
* Case 2 : "keep awake while in call" active : screen will go in "DIM" mode (low backlight) after the same delay than in the last point.</p></markdown-widget>
