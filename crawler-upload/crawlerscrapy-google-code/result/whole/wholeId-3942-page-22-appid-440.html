1.Receive call on my SIP
2.Answer call
3.Wait for them to hang up, then call out (outbound works fine)</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expect incoming calls to activate my microphone (I'm assuming that is the problem...)</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
csipsimple version: 0.01-01 r615
Android OS version: 2.2.1 (LG Optimus V)</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>INBOUND CALLS STILL RING</p>

<p>First used SIPdroid, worked ok, switched to csipsimple for integrated dialer - everything worked great for almost a month, then inbound calls broke. Using a pbxes account, and outbound calls work as expected, but now need to wait and call back (outbound) whenever I receive a call. Tried STUN, no help (may have caused other problems while enabled).</p>

<p>The issue did not arise with an update that I know of, either. So I'm not sure what happened, but as I continue to troubleshoot and support the csipsimple project, I will be using sipDroid for functionality of incoming calls :-(</p>

<p>Most of the time it means that something goes wrong at some state of the SIP invite.</p>

<p>If you say that it worked and suddently does not work anymore, my think is about length of UDP packets. CSipSimple support many codecs. The bad side of that is that it make UDP packets bigger. Some routers does not allow big packets in UDP.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in nightly builds there is a new feature to reduce packets size. (It's in network settings &gt; compact mode).
You can also disable some codecs. I'm almost sure that your sip provider does not support SILK for example, so useless to announce it in SIP Invites :). You can just disable it in codecs list.</p>

<p>Quick note about nightly builds, as their name suggest, it's rebuilt each night, so "latest" always evolves ;).</p>

<p>Also, I'd suggest you to activate STUN (I fixed things in nightly builds so that stun does not fail after some usage). Sipdroid activate it by default. I do not cause in some country it provide a very bad user experience.</p></markdown-widget>

However, I've just commit yesterday a new feature : themes :). And there is a first theme that take resources from the AOSP stock dialer (need the stock phone app of the android project to be installed on your phone). ( <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimpleThemeAOSP.apk">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/downloads/detail?name=CSipSimpleThemeAOSP.apk</a> )</p>

<p>About packet size it may have change. Did you look inside CSipSimple settings? There is a list of codecs in media settings. You can check that only the one you want are activated (white row). You can disable useless rows by long pressing the row and select de-activate.
And did you try the "SIP compact" option?
And last question, are you using the Pbxes.org wizard for your pbxes.org account or another wizard?</p>

<p>Also be careful sipdroid and CSS can conflit if they run both at the same time (there is network resource that has to be acquired by a sip client).</p>

<p>Anyway I'd be interested by logs. Read the HowToCollectLogs wiki page to know how collect and send me logs.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The change required was removing some of the available codecs, as suggested by r3gis.  I just kept removing a few until it started working.  I also tried to enable the "SIP Compact" option, but that prohibited CSipSimple from registering with pbxes.org so I left it disabled.</p>

<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a></p>

<p>However do not activate compact mode, pbxes.org does not support that correctly. Also, you can try to disable all codec but PCMU/PCMA in a first time for wifi and all but GSM for 3G.
Since some sip servers are buggy and does not support that the client lock the codec once the call is established, it may result in some problem with the codec finally used. If it does not work, I'm interesting in logs get with HowToCollectLogs procedure.
