Is it possible to configure the user agent (string) sent when using a specific account?
Not even sure if this conforms with the SIP protocol, but I know some providers want us to use their SIP clients. Therefore they perform some check in the UA string. Dropping the registration request if it's not what they were expecting to see.</p>

<p>Not sure that per account setting really make sense. 
Would mean that you found 2 different crappy provider.
For now only one is known and added as wizard.
Feel free to tell if you'd like me to create a wizard for your provider.</p>

<p>And anyway can't be per account because of the sip stack that consider this setting as global.</p></markdown-widget>

I had miss the 'ExpertSettingMode'. Thanks!</p>

<p>Also, thanks for offering to create the wizard. But this is actually already there (World Wide Providers &gt; Optimus), but somehow it's not working. I believe it might have to do with the resolution of the name sip.optimus.pt (it's not published in any DNS, but the captures I've made with my PC lead me to believe this needs to be statically added to 62.169.66.41). Is it possible to create this static DNS entry within CSipSimple?
I'm new to android too, so I'm still snooping around where to add this config :)</p></markdown-widget>

Use the expert setting mode to transform the account into an expert wizard one so that you can edit all settings.</p>

<p>the sip.optimus.tp is resolved as a DNS SRV entry (you'll not resolved if you try to do a standard dns query but with an _sip._udp srv request you can get the resolution).
CSipSimple support this option (in network settings) but it's not enabled by default (because it slow down the mobile application).</p>

<p>If you find a working configuration, let me know, I'll update the optimus wizard.</p>

<p>Maybe you can continue on issue 1038 ? I don't know if you get same symptoms. </p>

<p>The weird point is that it worked when user that provided me infos tested the wizard. So maybe optimus changed something meanwhile.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Normally who's to blame for that is not the sip client (that already support one global setting for user agent)... but rather the sip provider that force you to use their SIP client only ! It goes against principle of SIP standard protocol. </p>

<p>It's like if a website could be seen by a browser only... The workaround for that in webbrowser is to have a global option to change the user agent globally (and blame website for allowing only one browser). There is no per website user agent setting. </p>

<p>It's the same here. My personal opinion is that would be loss of time to have it per account instead of asking SIP provider to be real SIP providers and leave their users free. Also, they could do more complicate than just user agent and start differ from standard SIP protocol if they want to break a simple user agent change... so endless fight.</p>

<p>Doing the app my goal is to make users free and I don't loss time fighting against providers that tries to force their users to get stuck to their software. I prefer advising users to cry against such providers and request for freedom. </p>

<p>So, on my personal side I'll not loose time patching pjsip for that. <em>But</em> if somebody contribute to pjsip user-agent option per account it will be a welcome improvement and will be integrated to the application ;).</p>

<p>I hope you understand my position, and if you are ready to dig into source code and contribute something to pjsip it will be welcome ;).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>Ok, if you want to have a look : 
it's used everywhere in pjsua-lib when a dialog is sent.
For example :
<a href="http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/browser/pjproject/trunk/pjsip/src/pjsua-lib/pjsua_core.c#L473">http://trac.pjsip.org/repos/browser/pjproject/trunk/pjsip/src/pjsua-lib/pjsua_core.c#L473</a>
There is multiple occurrences in pjsua_core and pjsua_acc.
The main idea of a fix would be to switch from global setting "pjsua_var.ua_cfg.user_agent" to a setting per account.
Depending on the place where it's used there is different ways to retrieve the account we are using for current transaction. For example there's a method to find which account is related to which network data.
Then it will be about to retrieve account configuration (it's in an array indexed by account id), and have a user agent setting in account configuration structure.</p></markdown-widget>
