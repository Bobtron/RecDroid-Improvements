<p>CSipSimple should already be integrated to android stock dialer. If the option is activated in csipsimple setting, when you place an outgoing call from contact, or from stock dialer, you should see the csipsimple outgoing call popup that allow you to choose between gsm/mobile and sip accounts. 
This popup is not shown if the current network is not allowed for outgoing calls or if you configured filters to exclude current outgoing phone number.</p>

<p>If it does not work, that's maybe a bug. There is a known issue with some ROM that does modify the stock android phone application (MUI ROM). In this case I could not really integrate correctly to this phone application cause they do not respect they way it works on android. 
And I don't want to integrate the crappy way done by skype that does not allow to cleanly implement filters and to not show the popup when the current network is not available for outgoing sip calls.</p></markdown-widget>

Or in settings &gt; user interface &gt; integrate dialer &amp; integrate call logs.</p>

<p>Integrate dialer should allow to do exactly what you'd like to do. As I described, there is also a feature to allow you to automatically rewrite phone number or to force call through sip or through gsm according to rules.
The integrate call log feature should allow the app to fill the stock call logs with sip call logs.</p>

<p>If csipsimple popup is not shown when yuo place a call from the stock dialer, it could be a bug or because motorola did a weird thing with their dialer and does not respect the android API. If so there is unfortunately nothing I can do....</p>

<p>This feature already works well on all other phones I was able to test on. But maybe motorola did something that broke that. And this feature was very important to me and is functional from the very beggining of the project ! With the filters and rewriting rules approach it's one of the reason why I did my own SIP app ;)</p>

<p>Maybe, it could be interesting for me if you can collect some logs to see what motorola raise when a gsm call is initiated.
To do so :
* activate logs recording in csipsimple (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page)
* Go in stock dialer while wifi is on
* Place a call from stock dialer or from a contact -- the number you call doesn't really matter as far as you never created a filtering rule in csipsimple, so you can call the voice mail.
* stop the call
* go back in csipsimple, and stop and send recorded logs.
I may find some intersting clue about why motorola is bypassing the standard way to make call in android.</p>

<p>Also if you can give me model and rom version of your android could be interesting for me (even if logs may contain this information)

Are you sure that you don't see a popup even very quickly when you make an outgoing call from stock dialer?
I can even see that there is 7 second between the moment the popup from csipsimple to choose outgoing transport and the moment the use mobile row is pressed.</p>

<p>Besides on HTC devices I'm sure that the HTC sense interface does not break my integration.
You should see something like the first screen shot here : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/UsingFilters?wl=en">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/UsingFilters?wl=en</a>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, I wasn't sure to understand what you asked for from the begging :).</p>

<p>Well let me explain you why these two dialers are absolutely necessary :</p>

<p>The stock dialer is absolutely necessary because it is some stock app that is installed on your phone as part of the ROM. We can't delete this one from csispimple, and besides that's not something that would be user friendly.
We can integrate to it using a popup way : allowing you to choose the outgoing mean you want to use. This integration can be clever and it is configurable in csipsimple using filtering and rewriting rules.
You can use this dialer if you are used to. </p>

<p>The CSipSimple dialer is there in the case you don't want to use the integrated way (and disabled that from csipsimple settings). I don't encourage to use this dialer for mainstream users. I think that mainstream users should continue using the stock dialer and to configure filtering rules to have the popup only shown when they dial something that could be reached using SIP. It's just some duplicate you may want to use depending on your usage of your SIP account. The contact list available in csipsimple is also a duplicate of the stock contact list. You may still prefer the stock contact app than using csipsimple to dial a contact (or even you should use another app that manage contact, or a shortcut on the home screen of your android).
So, just don't "launch" the app !! :) And you'll never see csipsimple dialer. 
You can do everything else than configuring the application from the stock dialer, so just use it instead of csipsimple dialer. 
When you make your outgoing call from the stock dialer, csipsimple "dialer" is not raised: if you choose sip, it will directly goes to the SIP in-call screen user interface.</p>

<p>On the other side, if you want to stop using the stock android dialer - if you think csipsimple dialer is better/ but I don't think so ;) - you can also do... : 
In csipsimple there is a little button on the top right corner of the dialer that allow you to choose which mean you want to use for the next call. It allow you to use GSM too !!</p>

<p>So indeed there is two dialers, that's something absolutely impossible to avoid : there is two applications... there is two dialers. 
You could try to uninstall the stock phone app... but I don't think that's a good idea !</p>

<p>The point is that it's just up to you to choose the app/dialer you prefer ! When you launch the csipsimple app don't blame me for seeing csipsimple dialer... Launch the stock dialer if you intent to see the stock dialer. Then enjoy the fact csipsimple can intercept the fact stock dialer is initiating a call and allow you to choose between sip and gsm. Android is the <em>only</em> mobile OS that allow this kind of integration. This is absolutely impossible to do on iPhone for example. On iphone you will have only 2 dialers, and if you intent to call through GSM, you have to open GSM dialer, and if you want to dial using SIP you have to open sip app dialer, and if you want to use skype you have to open skype dialer. On android, we can from an intent initated from any app intercept the fact that you are doing an external call and give you a chance to choose the mean you want to use. </p>

<p>To sum up :
* CSipSimple is integrated to the stock dialer app via the popup shown to you
* The fact that the popup is shown is something you can configure in csipsimple
* CSipSimple dialer on its side allow you to dial using gsm
* csipsimple dialer can be themed to have other looks.</p>

<p>I don't see very well what I could do more than that. If your point is to remove the csipsimple dialer from csipsimple interface, that's not a good idea cause many user still prefer to use that and does not want to use the integrated way. If your point is to remove the phone stock dialer ... cry to motorola they do not use csipsimple as their stock phone app :p ...</p>

<p>Then, it's up to you to choose the UI you prefer. CSipSimple's UI is based on opensource dialer interface; There is a way to create theme plugin to match more what it look likes on your phone dialer app. For now I already did that for sony ericson and for other android opensource versions... If other developpers wants to create themes that match more look on other manufacturer customizations they are free to do so.</p></markdown-widget>
