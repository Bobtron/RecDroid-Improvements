                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well good idea.</p>

<p>First source code is up to date : <a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/list">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/source/list</a> we are at revision 612 and you can see in nightly builds <a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a> revision 606 and will be automatically build tonight :).</p>

<p>You probably miss the HowToBuild wiki page cause building CSipSimple is not so simple ;) .</p>

<p>Then as per your request.
I'd advise you to read : 
issue 586
issue 267
and issue 279</p>

<p>As you'll probably read my approach for this kind of request is to advise to do a third party application specialized in those kind of stuff.
The main reason is that doing a third party app is much much much more powerful than trying to do that within the SIP client
The second reason is that it will make much more complicated the settings of CSipSimple while most users may not use the feature
The third reason is that the approach I propose is the approach of the overall Android OS. We are EXTREMLY lucky to have an OS that is very very well designed by Google engineers. The interop of applications with each others is something that is just amazing in Android. For example iphone owners can't have such an experience ... everything that iphone can do is handle uri... poor... Here Android can do almost everything we could imagine in terms of exchanges between apps. </p>

<p>CSipSimple already provide a full API to allow a third party app to control it. (see the package com.csipsimple.api). Some SIP provider will use it to provide a third party app that rely on the service provided by CSipSimple. But it can be used to address your needs.</p>

<p>If you'd like to implement yourself a quick application that just activate / deactivate accounts according network, I can host it on CSipSimple project and distribute it too if you'd like (but you can also distribute and host it where you want). 
But I think that the best approach for the future remain a true opensource context aware application with plugins. 
If there is such a project (if somebody starts such a project) I'll do "output" plugins to control CSipSimple... and then we will be able to use all input plugins (those that detect the wifi ssid, those that are aware of time, etc etc :) :) ).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Is there any method at all for finding the acc_id which is not programmatic. For example, can I do something which will print the acc_id into the log file? If I create a new account while logging is enabled will the acc_id appear in the log somewhere?</p>

<p>I have tried acc_id of 0 and acc_id of 1 without success. There was a posting which says acc_id increments based on creation date. I assume that means that acc_id is more random than a single digit number?</p>

<p>It seems like there are multiple references to tasker and csipsimple inter-operability via intents, but I am unable to find any positive posting or recipe to follow to make this work.</p>

<p>I understand the philosophy of not implementing a specific interface for a closed source app, but in theory the intent interface should work. I think it would be very useful for many people if I could some how get this to work and write up the recipe. I think the missing piece of information is the acc_id. If it can be printed into the log, that would be great.</p>

<p>If anyone actually has a working tasker/csipsimple recipe, I would be very appreciative if they would respond.</p>
