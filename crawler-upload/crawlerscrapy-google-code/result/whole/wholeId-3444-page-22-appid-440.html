                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Configure CSS to make a direct call (without any registration required)
2. Make a call, watch for KA packets (there is no one)
3. Terminate the call by called party. CSS will not receive BYE message from SIP server (NAT hole in control channel is closed after a while)</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Expected: CSS during direct call should send KS packets to SIP server, keeping NAT hole alive
Instead: CSS doesn't send keep alive packets, allowing NAT hole for control channel to close in a while </p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
r1064, Android 2.1</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>CSS sends KA packets (2 bytes) every 120 sec (as it's configured with "WiFi keep alive" option) when CSS has registered itself with SIP server. It still keep sending KA packets during call sessions, keeping NAT hole alive during calls. But when CSS makes direct calls to other SIP servers (without registering into their local accounts) - CSS stops sending KA packets during active calls (to be more precise - it never starts). And it creates problem with receiving the last SIP message terminating the call - BYE, from that SIP server. Call reminds never ending then... I have to hang up CSS manually.</p>

<p>To see the problem - you may use FreeSWITCH as a SIP server. When direct calls are established and in progress, run this command in console:
sofia loglevel all 9</p>

<h2>Then watch for KA packets coming (or not, in this case) from CSS. KA packets usually are logged as:</h2>

<p>tport_wakeup_pri(016BFD00): events IN
tport_recv_event(016BFD00)
tport(016BFD00) msg 01694CC0 from (udp/192.168.1.XX:5060) has 2 bytes, veclen = 1</p>

<h2>tport(016BFD00): bad msg 01694CC0 (2 bytes) from udp/AA.AA.AA.AA:5060/sip next=00000000</h2>

<p>Please make sure, that CSS sends its KA messages during any active calls (direct and/or requiring registration). Otherwise, if call takes more then a couple of minutes and there is a NAT between CSS and SIP server, CSS looses control channel with SIP server.</p></markdown-widget>

<a href="http://lists.pjsip.org/pipermail/pjsip_lists.pjsip.org/2011-November/013672.html">http://lists.pjsip.org/pipermail/pjsip_lists.pjsip.org/2011-November/013672.html</a>
It indeed make sense for mainstream use case.</p>

<p>As mentionned by Saúl here, 
<a href="http://lists.pjsip.org/pipermail/pjsip_lists.pjsip.org/2011-November/013671.html">http://lists.pjsip.org/pipermail/pjsip_lists.pjsip.org/2011-November/013671.html</a>, it would be possible to develop a pjsip module that sends OPTIONS to keep alive while in call with a sip server from an account without proxy. 
Maybe would be a solution, even if may consume more data bandwidth than just \r\n. </p>

<p>So I tag this issue as an enhancement on csipsimple side to have such a module. Since it's a use case that is not main stream I do not put a high priority on it, however if you'd like to contribute (or somebody else) this feature to the project, it will be welcome : it's opensource ;) </p></markdown-widget>

  <p>I think when you're behind NAT, you should always send the call via 
  the server (i.e. not directly to callee). If you call direct, your 
  Contact URI will be wrong if you're behind symmetric NAT.
  That's wrong premise. It's not true for correctly configure SIP client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sending KA messages should be done by SIP client (behind a NAT or not), if it cares to keep control channel alive during an active call. Otherwise that SIP client becomes unreliable (it could work under some circumstances, while it could not under some others)...</p>

<p>Actually CSS is the only client, that exhibits that problem. Other UAC keep control connection alive. For example, PhonerLite SIP client (Windows, desktop) sends on a scheduled time (as I've set - 120 sec) 0 bytes packets. Those 0 bytes packets keep control connection alive during all direct calls. It's done independently of environment - is it behind NAT or not... In comparison, CSS sends 2 bytes KA messages, but only when client is registered (and not during all active calls).</p>

<p>I guess the library has some function that triggers KA process (when I set/change KA interval in UI). Why it can't start the same KA process during all active calls? Obviously PhonerLite does something like that and that makes it reliable SIP client...</p>

<p>If pjsip developers don't see the need to support KA for control channel under all conditions (registered or not), could you please at least try suggestion to send OPTION packets during all active direct calls?</p></markdown-widget>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, it's sometimes impossible to configure correctly the public IP. 
I guess the point of Benny is about the fact that for mainstream users configuration, it's easier and better to use a SIP server. BTW, that's what is used by 90% of users.</p>

<p>I'm not telling your request is pointless, and I agree with you that the implementation done on pjsip probably lack something. 
However, I disagree with the fact "CSS is the only client" with this problem. First you'll have all sip client based on pjsip. And there is not only csipsimple !!! There is at least all projects based on pjsip : <a href="http://www.pjsip.org/apps.htm">http://www.pjsip.org/apps.htm</a>. And the stack is widely used on mobile plateforms. On android there is also 3cx and I even read that Bria use pjsip stack (but both are closed source while I opensourced my work).
I've also quickly checked sipdroid source, and same problem... They only send KA on the sip server they register on... </p>

<p>So on android, is that the <em>only</em> client with this problem ?!?!</p>

<p>Well, then about the point. I think this is indeed a true issue. 
However, sounds there is no willing from pjsip guys to support this kind of topology. I can understand their arguments. 
So the solution, -as I said in my previous comment- is to implement to send OPTION packets on active calls as suggested by Saúl. That's why I changed the status of the bug from WontFix (cause I thought was relevant of pjsip stack) to Accepted-Enhancement cause should be added on the application side as an additional option on the top of the stack. 
However, it is not something with very high priority for me. CSipSimple is very young project and I have so many other things to improve that will improve things for the 100% of users. But again, the project is opensource, if you or somebody else find this feature important and want to add it the app he will be obviously welcome. If nobody take the point, I'll do that when I'll get some time. 
I personally do the project on my own time, night and week ends. Support of the app, investigating issues and trying to reply everyone take a lot of time. So I get few time left for development ;). 
So you have to be patient if you want to see that in csipsimple or to develop that by your own ;). </p>

<p>Maybe you could share names of other android apps for other users with the same problem. 
Linphone or imsdroid maybe? I don't know what are their status about that. 
I know that imsdroid is very good and also has a very clean backend as good as pjsip (even better on some points). </p>

<p>My goal is not to get more users. My goal is only to share my little and modest app and to see happy users. At the beggining was only something I did for my own needs. It's now a little bit bigger and it's even reused by many sip provider as a base for their branded app. But I do not made any benefit about that.
So do not hesitate to share here list of other apps on android that supports this correctly. There is absolutely no problem :). I'm even very interested in it because csipsimple could in the future rely on different backend than pjsip. 
My software design is flexible enough to envisage in the future to have other sip stack as backend in plugins of csipsimple in the future. </p>

<p>The first one would probably be the stock android sip stack, and the second one will probably be imsdroid (doubango) -- the author of doubango already helped me on csipsimple on other topics and their spirit is the same than mine : trying to bring cool stuff to end users, but their app interface is not really end user oriented for now, which could be brought by csipsimple interface ;). 
So, if there is other backends with better implementation, I'm very interested in it.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Actually I mentioned SIP clients on different platforms (mainly Windows desktop, not mobile). On Android platform I started with Sipdroid and then moved to CSipSimple as it offers more flexibility and support for many SIP accounts at the same time, along with easy way to manage them (choose which one to use to make a call, making backups, editing configuration with a text editor, ability to restore it at any time, etc). That's what I need from SIP application and thank you for great job here! It may be true, that 90% of users don't need that flexibility (talking about user base), but I certainly need it and really appreciate it :) And BTW, one of the reasons why I don't have big experience with other SIP clients on Android is the good set of features, offered by CSS itself :)</p>

<p>Regis, it's really good to know that you have successfully separated GUI and made it independent from SIP stack and therefore you can use other SIP stacks under the CSipSimple. It's a really wise design choice to keep it independent. If PJSIP developers don't share concern about keeping control channel alive during all active calls - others may implement it within other SIP stacks without any questions asked...</p>

<p>Regarding to the fix, I promise, I'll be patient and wait when you'll have time to implement KA based on sending OPTIONS packets during active calls. And BTW, I really appreciate your hard work on CSipSimple. Great job! Thank you :)</p></markdown-widget>
