1. Initiate/answer a SIP call
2. Keep the call active until the screen goes blank after timeout
3. Try to talk</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
Talking should be possible after the screen goes blank.
Instead, sound becomes garbled. Waking up the phone with power button makes it normal again.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
"pre3" apk on HTC Desire (Android 2.1).</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<p>I heard a rumor that due to an HTC specific bug(?) CPU lock is not sufficient to keep the hardware running at full speed, screen lock is needed as well. This may be completely wrong though.</p>

This can be proven if you run "ping -i 0.2 " against your phone. As the screen darkens, you will notice that ping responses are coming, roughly, in bursts of five once a second. Obviously when there is significant data stream, the AP is unable to hold the whole second-worth of data and only short snippets of the RTP stream are coming through once a second. Thus choppy sound.
Now unfortunately android's official API does not have anything to control this behavior. Famous WifiLock is, according to the documentation, about quite a different thing: <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager.WifiLock.html">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager.WifiLock.html</a>

<p>Just a precision, to precise how csipsimple handle wifi while there is an ongoing call.
There is of course a wifi lock that is asked by csipsimple, but there is also something that try to set the wifi sleep policy to never sleep :
Settings.System.putInt(ctntResolver, Settings.System.WIFI_SLEEP_POLICY, Settings.System.WIFI_SLEEP_POLICY_NEVER);
<a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/fr/reference/android/provider/Settings.System.html#WIFI_SLEEP_POLICY_NEVER">http://developer.android.com/intl/fr/reference/android/provider/Settings.System.html#WIFI_SLEEP_POLICY_NEVER</a></p>

<p>On my device (N1 Froyo), it seems to work as expected since I never get choppy sound. But, as you said, it's possible that on other devices such as HTC Desire, wifi goes in a sleep mode state or this PSP mode.
What is possible too is that on the N1, setting wifi sleep policy to never also prevent the PSP mode you described and that on Desire it only prevent wifi to be disconnected.</p>

<p>So, if this is the cause of the choppy sound, my only solution is to add an option to allow "Force screen on while in a WIFI SIP call".
Fortunately, I have also planned a visual locker in addition of the proximity sensor.
I don't know if you ever seen that, but on the HTC G1 and G2, that had no proximity sensor, after a timeout, a lock screen was displayed and you had to double tap on it to unlock.
I think I will also implement that. So even with unlocked screen, the interface will prevent you to initiate some unwanted actions.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>As to WIFI_SLEEP_POLICY, it looks like it manages the same aspect of the system behaviour as the WifiLock:</p>

<p>"The policy for deciding when Wi-Fi should go to sleep (which will in turn switch to using the mobile data as an Internet connection)."</p>

<p>I.e. switch to PSP mode is made if the adapter is <em>not</em> sleeping. "Going to sleep" means turning it off altogether and switching to mobile data connection.</p>

<p>What you suggest sounds as a good enough solution to me. I think that you could introduce an option "Keep awake while on call" and if it is set, acquire (SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK|ON_AFTER_RELEASE) powermanager lock for the duration of the call. If you do, I'd be happy to test. Thanks!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>It add the keep awake while in call option. Not yet the visual locker, but that's the next step :)</p>

<p>Btw, there is still something bad : I can't prevent the user from pushing the power button that force the device to go in sleep mode and consequently activating PSP mode.</p>

<p>P.S. : I'm able to reproduce with my nexus one in fact. But strangely on my device the choppy sound is only in one way. PSP mode seems to affect only for RX and not TX...</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I would not bother about it. "Just don't do it!"</p>

  <p>I'm able to reproduce with my nexus one in fact.
  But strangely on my device the choppy sound is only in one way.
  PSP mode seems to affect only for RX and not TX...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating! I think the explanation may be simple: radio is turned on every time when there is something to send, but to receive, it just polls once a second.</p>

<p>I was wondering why "internet radio" streaming is not affected. I have no proven theories; my first hypothesis was that as streaming is (often) done over tcp, tcp flow control kicks in and prevents overflow of the buffers on the AP. Then when I read your comment I thought that maybe it's the upstream packets that keep the adapter awake, and if you are silent and VAD is active, there are no upsteam RTP packets. In case of tcp, ACKs could play the role of such waking upstream packets. However, it it was true, then you could try talking constantly and then choppy incoming sound would have become normal. This is not happening in my tests, so no such luck...</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I'm having the issue that the screen <em>does</em> not turn off on my HTC Desire, even if I want it to. Im running the newest Cyanogen 6.1.1 (device still reported as HTC Desire), which seems to fix the WiFi screen sleep problems: turning off the screen by pressing the power button does not at all interrupt the ongoing call.</p>

<p>In another ticket I found a reference to an option in the UI settings screen, which does not seem to be available on my install (latest marketplace). Do I need to switch to nightlies?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></markdown-widget>

There is expert option for power users :)
Read this page : ExpertSettingMode 
You'll be able to disable the option "keep awake while in call".</p>

<p>Indeed that's not need with CM builds cause they deactivate PSP behavior of the wifi card.</p>

<p>And in CM7 I heard that it will not needed anymore for stable 2.3 cause I'll use a new API that allow PSP behavior and full speed locks on it.</p></markdown-widget>
