                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p><b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1.  Set DTMF mode to In band generation (or any other for that matter).
2.  Make or receive a call via csipsimple.
3.  During the call use the dial pad to attempt to generate DTMF tones.
4.  The DTMF tones do not seem to transmit.</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
  During the call I need to be able to transmit DTMF tones.  I need this because when I receive a call I need to press "1" or it will goto voice mail (I can not disable this).  I have tested using various test numbers and even my own voice mail and none of them ever receive DTMF tones.  I tested all settings for DTMF tones (RTP, In band, and SIP INFO).  All audio from the microphone IS transmitted properly.  The problem is when I use the dial pad no tones are actually transmitted.  I have this same problem with every SIP program I have used on Android.  I do not have this problem when using my ATA device at home.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
  I am using csipsimple 0.00-16 r410.  I am using it with Gizmo Project as my SIP provider.  I am on Android version 2.2.1, Baseband 32.41.00.32U_5.08.00.04, Kernel 2.6.35.6 MIUI@MIUI #13.  My settings are as follows:
Server: proxy01.sipphone.com
STUN:   stun01.sipphone.com
ICE:    Disabled</p>

Calling my SIP via google voice and answering with my ATA it allows the call to connect when I press 1 on my phone connected to my ATA.  My ATA was setup for in band generation but I set it to RTP and it also seems to work fine.  When I do the exact same test except picking up using Csipsimple I am unable to do the same thing.  I tested with RTP, In band, and SIP INFO.  None of them worked.  I am a bit confused as at the least RTP and In band work properly when I am using my ATA.
Also, something to note... when I call my provider's SIP echo test address RTP and SIP INFO do not work.  In Band does but it sounds really messy.  Gizmo also has a SIP  test address for skype.  When calling that RTP and In band work but also sound messy.  This definitely seems like a provider issue even though it does work with my ATA.  I am thinking about using SIPgate once I am able... though I am out of the US for now so I will have to get a friend in the states to help me register =/.  Same with registering for GV for now I think.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Just something that may help you to understand some behaviors :
RTP and SIP INFO does not produce sound. It's informations sent by another way. In band generation simulate the sound and send it as if it was produced by micro.</p>

<p>I guess that your ATA phone behaves like my "Auto" mode in RTP mode. (It tries RTP and if not acknowledge by other side fallback to in-band generation).
However some sip gateways transform RTP or INFO into sound if the sound then need to be sent to another network.
So usually the more reliable way to send is to use in-band even if it's less robust to low bandwidth and sound distortions due to the network. (Reason why by default it's Auto = RTP and if fail in-band -- however some gateway announce to support RTP but doesn't actually transform RTP to in-band on their side, and as far as I understood from other users that have a Gizmo account, it's the case of gizmo : they announce to support RTP but actually does not =&gt; in this case you have to choose "In band generation which will enforce inband)</p>

<p>One thing strange in your descriptions is that sometimes you hear the tones produced by csipsimple on csipsimple side which should never happen (unless there is something wrong on my code). I'll check that and keep you in touch.</p>

<p>Another possibility if tones are messy on the other side is that codec transform it badly. What codec are you using? (some codecs are optimized for speech and may truncate high frequency dtmf tones).
(Press the little (i) button while in call to know what codec is currently in use).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Actually, my background is telecom so I am a bit familiar with DTMF and understand what the difference between RTP and In Band generation are.  I do thank you for your very sufficient explanation though ^^.  I am only doing short tests with myself since I can call it from GV for free and at the moment I don't have a phone setup in the US other than via Gizmo.  I will do a little more testing as well as try and use a friend or family member in the US as a guinea pig to test with.  I will put more detailed descriptions of exactly each test and result.</p>

<p>I am sorry but I think I did not explain my descriptions well.  The test numbers I were calling either echoed back what it heard after recording for a few seconds (Skype) and the other just echoed back with about a 1 second delay (Gizmo).  When I say they sounded messy I mean that they sounded very distorted.  I will double check as I am not sure which codecs Gizmo supports but the top of both my ATA's codec list as well as csipsimple is PCMU 8kHz.  I am not sure there is a way to verify what my ATA is using but I will verify what csipsimple is using today.</p>

<p>One thing I find really odd though... is that when using my ATA for receiving a call from GV.  After I confirm the audio is working both ways I try using the dial pad to generate tones.  When pressing any of the buttons the incoming audio mutes on the GV side.  My guess is it may be recognizing the tone and muting it out purposely.   This happens with both RTP and In Band.</p>

<p>Another thing I would like to note, when switching between DTMF modes immediately after a call it failed to open a media stream I think it is.  It continues to do this.  I think that was the error message.  There were some weird characters at the end of the message as if it was supposed to have a meaningful number or ID or something but possibly came up with something else instead.  I will take note of the exact error next time I see it.  I did not try forcing the program to close but just rebooted to get it to work normally again.</p>

<p>One last thing, even though I have "Lock WIFI" and "Keep awake while on call" during a call when I cover the light sensor to make the screen shut off... all audio stops.  It does not start again until the screen is on.  Again, once I do some more testing this afternoon I will put up more information concerning this also.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I'm thinking this is a problem of Google Voice's Verification process!!</p>

<p>I installed and setup SipDroid and verified my Gizmo voice number without issue. I then went back to using cSipSimple and tested DTMF tones (set to In Band mode) with an automated message hotline and the DTMF tones worked flawlessly! So for some reason there seems to be some DTMF issues with cSipSimple/Google Voice number verification/Gizmo5. But the fix is easy (just use SipDroid to verify number)!</p></markdown-widget>

I should probably report that we are affected too.
Maybe I could also dive into the code and if Alexei is right on the mailing list there is maybe a relevant change in pjsip that can be responsible (maybe even some configuration issue cause I remember of some change about RTP payload in pjsip).</p></markdown-widget>
