1. Installed Asterisk 1.8.4.4
2. Added a user 1234 and 1235 in sip.conf
3. Changed standard bind port from 5060 to 50600 (bindport).
3. Registered CSipSimple with 1234, and a SPA2102 box with 1235 using the local IP address:port (192.168.2.1:50600). I used the simple wizard to configure CSipSimple. The setup was tested on a local network.
4. Called extension 1234 using the SPA2102 (i.e. from user 1235).
5. CSipSimple rings, I pick up the call, there is audio and everything seems to operate. However after about 60 seconds, the call terminates.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li><p>The call does NOT terminate when I call the other way (from CSipSimple to the SPA2102).</p></li>
<li><p>The call does NOT terminate when I use Linphone instead of CSipSimple.</p></li>
<li><p>The call does NOT terminate when I use the standard SIP port 5060 even when I use CSipSimple. This points to a possible problem with how CSipSimple handles non-standard SIP ports???</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>I expect the call not to terminate.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>The Android app. The latest version from the Android Market.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b></p>

<ul>
<li>I hope you are able to reproduce this. I am fairly certain from my testing that changing the bindport to 50600 was sufficient to reproduce the behavior.</li>

<p>Normally max TCP port for userspace is 65534 for most unix installation. However, it's hightly possible that your android OS does not allow to go up to this port for user space. 
So maybe not linked to the app but more to the android OS and rights it grants to an app. Since everything is managed on pjsip side it should be fine with non standard ports (pjsip is a well known and widely used sip stack and this kind of use case is highly tested on the sip stack side).</p>

<p>However, I'd be interested if you can collect logs (see the wiki page about HowToCollectLogs). It could confirm my guess.

<p>Sorry for the delay! Here is what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>1) To your point about the Android OS being the problem - please note that Linphone has no trouble maintaining a call even when the SIP port is set to something higher than 10,000.</p>

<p>2) PJSip may still be to blame, because Linphone has a different SIP stack (right??), and it is operating fine under the same conditions.</p>

<p>Do you still want me to collect logs? I still think the problem is not with Android, and is either with pjsip or with Csipsimple. If you have nothing to do with port numbers in CSipsimple, then the problem certainly lies with pjsip, and you can upstream this bugreport to them :D.</p>

<p>Cheers and thanks for looking into this for me!

I've no problem at all with a binding port set to 50600.</p>

<p>Are you sure we are talking about the same thing when saying binding port? 
In CSipSimple, binding port, is the local port on which the softphone listen on it side. Usually it is useless to change. Most of the time what is to be changed is the port of the registrar/proxy. But obviously this setting is not in the global configuration but in the account configuration (set registrar/proxy to server_ip:50600).</p>

<p>If you are absolutely sure you want to change the local binding port of the client, and that this does not work, yeah, indeed, I'm still interested by logs since I do not reproduce this with all my phones ;).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Just keep it to 0 (the default is to choose a random free port).
Then in your account, edit the server field.
Instead of server_ip (or server_domain), type server_ip:50600 (or server_domain:50600).</p>

<p>Once this is done, you have to make sure your sip server is properly configured to reply correctly the invite. Most sip client does not respect fully the RFCs and continue to reply the initiated ip:port instead of following what is replied by your server.
On it side, pjsip is very respectful with SIP RFCs. Sometimes it leads to some weird behavior which is not due to the client but to the way the server reply. (For example the symptom you describe are often encountered with TCP support which is not properly managed by the server).</p>

<p>If you can collect logs (see HowToCollectLogs wiki page), I'll be able to explain you what's going wrong with the way your server reply. AFAIK, Asterisk, if correctly configured, should not be buggy regarding this point. But that's a matter of configuration of the server.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I've been configuring only the registrar port all this time, not the bind
port for csipsimple. I am not sure where the confusion arose. :) If I was
not configuring the registrar port properly, my client would not have
registered at all! The problem here is call termination after 1 minute, not
inability to call.</p>

<p>I will collect logs when I get a chance. Also, I believe my asterisk server
is not buggy and is configured properly. Otherwise linphone (which works
with these settings without terminating the call) would not have worked
either.</p>

<p>Have you personally tried csipsimple on android registering to a sip server
on a port greater than 10000?</p>

<p>Cheers, and thanks for looking into this!

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok.</p>

<p>About the registrar, yes it was part of my tests, but I didn't try to monitor call establishement. I'll do that to be sure there is not something buggy in pjsip.</p>

<p>My point was about what happen after call is established. Many sip stacks does not update dialog with what is sent from server. It's usually harmless. But it does not respect SIP RFC.</p>

<p>For example there is an open issue with TCP and pbxes.org. The call establish properly, but the server update the dialog using transport UDP. Sipdroid (which is developped by pbxes.org guys), does not update the dialog and keep using the TCP transport to hack and end the call. pjsip on its side update the dialog and as the server is now telling to use UDP, just use udp. As consequence, any hack and bye packets sent to pbxes.org server are just ignored.
In this case, the problem is not on pjsip side since it follow SIP RFC but on what is replied by pbxes.org. (It should either reply with TCP transport or support the fact the client reply on UDP).</p>

<p>So it's not to exclude that at some time your server behaves the same way and tell pjsip to update the dialog with another port (for example if 5060 it is also opened on your server). 
So pjsip will try to continue using 5060 (and in this case, asterisk does not allow a sip client to start talking on another port).
This is very tricky but according to what you describe, it could be an explaination to what happens. 
And the most tricky thing is that there is really few sip stacks that behaves correctly regarding this part of the specification... so one could think the server is properly configured cause it works with most sip clients, while it actually take advantage of a miss in those sip clients.</p>

<p>So, logs get from csipsimple (no need to wireshark, logs created by csipsimple should be enought), could help to tell whether this is the root of the problem.</p>

<p>On my side I'll try to monitor a call with a registrar/proxy port higher than 10000 to see if there is something weird on pjsip side :)</p></markdown-widget>
