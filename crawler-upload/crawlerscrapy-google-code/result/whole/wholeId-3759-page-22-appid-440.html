It turns out that the Archos 43IT is unable to do Speex above 8kHz in real time.  The effect is that if the peer negotiates Speex-wb, the remote sound becomes choppy as the Archos is no longer able to encode all of the data.</p>

<p>I'm sure I'm not the only person in this situation, and I'm willing to bet that many of your "bad sound" bug reports are actually related to this issue.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure what's the best way to fix that.  Ideally, csipsimple would monitor CPU usage and dynamically switch to a lower complexity codec, but I'm not sure if the SIP protocol allows that.  It might be good enough to monitor the CPU and display a warning if it goes too high.  Alternatively, the installation wizard could test the speed of all codecs and disable those that are unable to run in real time.</p>

<p>A couple additional notes.  First, the Archos has a 1GHz Cortex-A8 (with NEON and a proprietary DSP); I'm not sure how that can fail to do Speex in real time.  Second, while I'm unable to test SILK, I've checked that G.722 works fine, so it's not a NB vs. WB issue.</p>

<p>In fact about the change of codec that's theorically possible, (it relies on reinvite), but could break the voice path for a little time and also it's not necessarily allowed by the other side.</p>

<p>Another point to be aware about is the fact the complexity is not necessarily linked to the frequency (as you noticed). For example if the android audio driver is opened @16kHz and the codec in use is the 16kHz codec it have lower cpu impact than using the 8kHz codec.
(You can change the audio frequency in csipsimple settings, it's usually recommanded to use 16kHz to have a good call quality).</p>

<p>Another point is the way the other side (or the media gateway) manage the codec. For example it's well known that some provider handle a very bad way some codecs. </p>

<p>I'm a little bit surprise that you get problems with a 1Ghz CPU to use speex upper than 8kHz. Even on a htc G2 with 600mHz I can use speex 32KHz without big degradation.</p>

<p>Are you sure csipsimple is overheading your cpu when using speex upper than 8kHz? I mean is that based on a observation (top command line for example), or just a guess about the fact you think it's linked to the cpu on your side?</p>

<p>Because it is possible that simply, the media gateway handle a very bad way speex upper than 8kHz (there is well known sip server implementation that have big issues with this codec)... So maybe not really linked to the cpu usage?</p></markdown-widget>

</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that it was not the codec, but the "Speex" echo cancellation algorithm -- switching to the "Simple" algorithm fixes the issue.  With "Speex" echo cancellation (200ms) and Speex-WB or -UWB, I was getting 100% CPU usage (87% in csipsimple, 5% in media server, 8% in the kernel) and the tablet was unbearably sluggish.</p>

<p>I don't think that "Speex" echo cancellation is the default setting (I'm not sure), so the default config is not at fault.  Still, I think that there should be some indication in the UI that the CPU is being maxed out.</p>

<p>As consequence all features that requires floating point should be disabled by default. 
In fact, all feature that requires floating point should use an armv7a build (cause armeabi build does not activate cpu floating point feature cause not available in armeabi).
As consequence this kind of feature (speex aec, iLBC codec) will continusly convert floating point to fix point variables. And this will increase really really fast CPU usage. 
As consequence using speex aec or iLBC on a build without floating point enabled will result dramatically bad performance. </p>

<p>I don't really know where to put the info on the UI about that. 
Besides the echo mode is (should be) reserved to the Expert setting mode. 
As consequence those who modify in expert mode ~should~ be aware about what they are doing or at least like you able to communicate on the issue list so that I can help to debug the issue ;). 
So I don't think that's reallly hurting to not have this in the UI since only for expert or users with a good level of knownledge or with mean to ask for help ;).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>The .abi is the arch the android os announce to applications. It's possible that even if your cpu is armv7, archos decided to announce to third party apps that it is a armeabi without v7 features.
And as consequence apps with native code will load their armeabi version (actually that's done automatically by the android OS).</p>

<p>Would be a shame if so and you should cry to archos about that.
You can also try to enforce the use of armeabi-v7a by using these builds (that only contains v7a library build) :
