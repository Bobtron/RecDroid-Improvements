                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>How do you expect DTMF to be sent?</p>

<p>There is 3 ways to send DTMF in SIP.
You can force each way in settings of the app.
 * The RTP way will pass over media stream with a specified RTP payload type. If you observe the audio stream with wireshark you'll not see that. You'll only see some particular RTP packets with a dedicated payload type (usually it's 101 but will depend on SDP neg)
 * The analogic tone generation will generate inside the audio media the tones generated with old way. It should produce some sound on the other side. This way will play well with legacy devices/servers or if there is gateways in the middle that doesn't supports the two others ways properly. However, if codec choosen in neg cuts high frequencies, it could loss information in the tones and not being able to be decoded properly on the other side.
 * The SIP INFO way. This will pass your DTMF on signalization sip layer. You should see in wireshark a full clear SIP exchange about an INFO request send from the app to the server.</p>

<p>Not all sip servers supports all cases. And worse, some announce to support some of the ways but actually just ignore it (or do not gateway it). So it's sometimes necessary to force in csipsimple settings one of the option.
By default it will try RTP if the other side announce to support it (which might be wrong), and fallback to analogic generation else.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok, so RFC2833 is what I called in last post the "RTP" way. It normally the default but it can be good to force it.</p>

<p>Normally, the DTMF in this mode is not linked to the audio layer, so it should not be impacted by the audio routing (rear speaker/headset). Also, the app doesn't feedback anything when you press the tone (because sometimes due to echo it interfere with the actual tone you send).</p>

<p>The tone feedback, if comes from somewhere, comes from the server.</p>

<p>So maybe could be interesting to check network quality and ensure there is not too much packet loss. You can click the "info" button of the call card to see the loss rate is big. Using more efficient audio codecs could relax bandwidth usage.</p>

<p>You can also try to upgrade to latest version. Can be an interesting test too (there is no specific bug fix for this problem, but it should be globally better regarding audio management) :
<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/CSipSimple-latest-trunk.apk">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/CSipSimple-latest-trunk.apk</a></p>

<p>As you are able to make wireshark trace I would also be very interested it dump you can collect. So that I can see RTP stream and check there is well something sent by the app. Send it directly by mail (developers [at] csipsimple.com) to me (publishing on public place is not good for privacy).</p></markdown-widget>

If I open the rtp stream and use the audio player I hear 1 click (the 2833) but nothing after that. The voice mail prompt ask for the 10 digit mail box number so I should be hearing more than just 1 click in the Stream. since I'm only getting the carrier side of the call I realize the captures are not going to tell the entire story. I did some further tweaks in the CSipSimple settings -&gt;User Interface. If I Change the dialing tone feed back to "prevent" all the digits go through (using the devices's rear speaker).

<p>I forgot that but I added something to have local feedback of the dtmf tone. Normally it should have been optional and disabled by default but as it's a setting that is shared between the dialpad and the dtmf pad... it was probably later re-enabled.</p>

<p>However, it should not be a problem for most devices, in your case, the problem is that it's a Samsung and Samsung devices usually requires audio workarounds to get audio working I think the audio stream where dtmf tones are and the stream where is actual audio are different in your case.
It probably locks the dtmf feedback and so it only send the first dtmf and gets locked.</p>

<p>I'll fix that right now and make a new option to have tone feedback separate between the dialpad and the dtmf pad.
Thanks a lot for the time you spent investigating, it was very valuable to find the root cause.</p>

<p>About the nightly build installation, if you never installed an apk from a file previously you have to go in android settings and search for an option to "allow unknown sources" (it's to allow files from something different than google play store). Depending on the android version this setting can be in Applications section or in Security or in developers options.</p></markdown-widget>
