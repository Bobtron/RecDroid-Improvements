Expected audio between both parties.
Got no audio and no dial tone.</p>

<p><b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Motorola Droid, 2.2, sip provider: voipbuster</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
To get audio I have to press and release soft HOLD button at the upper left corner of the app. What interesting is that it happened only when i make domestic call... Everything is working fine when it is international call.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I'll need a little bit more infos :
1 - Is bluetooth enabled? (I mean not is there a BT handset, just if BT is activated in android)</p>

<p>2 - Is that possible for you to provide me some logs :
    * Go to option &gt; settings &gt; Ui&gt; log level (last entry) and set it to 4
    * Reproduce a failing use case
    * Use a logcat app (such as alogcat available on the market) to send me your logs.</p>

<p>3 - another thing you can try is setting the sip proxy field (see instructions on issue 164 / comment 3 /problem 4</p></markdown-widget>

<p>On the log you sent to me, is the in call screen reach the green state (confirmed call / talking)? Or did it directly go from gray (ringing) to red (hangup)?</p>

<p>Seems the remote endpoint either hangup or decline your call (can be also the sip server that act like that).
* If you decline the call for the log, please try to take the call and provide me the log with an established communication (a few seconds will be enough).
* If you always reproduce this use case, the problem is not that there is no audio, but that the call is never established. As it seems to well negociate the codec (it use ilbc - not the best choice to start but should be ok even if choppy - you can try to disable it in the settings to start with a better and reliable codec). I think more that it's your server that doesn't understand the contact you are trying to call. Are you sure your sip server understand the "+" char? some configuration need it to be replaced by 00. </p></markdown-widget>

<p>For HTC desire, it's highly possible cause it's already known that HTC has PSP behavior when screen goes off. 
In latest dev version (<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a>) it should be correctly auto-detected now and automatically activate the workaround against PSP problem.</p>

<p>On Milestone I'm less sure. It's maybe PSP. You can try to activate the PSP workaround manually.
Activate ExpertSettingMode (wiki page =&gt; for global settings), and in User interface &gt; activate Keep awake while in call.</p>

<p>But could also be some routing issue. If so maybe worth to try what is listed here :

<p>I'm not sure it will help, but since CM7 on HTC desire audio driver may not integrate the new API for sip calls, you should try to revert to default modes (instead of the one I set when I detect Gingerbread cause I assume all manufacturer did things to support the new audio modes) :
Micro source : select default instead of communication
Mode for sip calls : select normal instead of in_communication.</p></markdown-widget>

I also reverted to using a local authentication on the same network as the SIP server (avoiding STUN problems), it didn't change anything.
According to my asterisk server logs, everything looks fine, sounds are played correctly and there's no visible handshake problem.</p>
