1. Samsung Galaxy i7500 - Today returned from service with Android 1.6
Donut (was 1.5 before)
2. Install and run MediaLibGet</p>

<p><b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
I get on screen message:
" Email:
  No application can perform this action."</p>

<p><b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
From contacts if I choose someones email address it offers me to send email
using one of two offered email clients.</p>

<p>By the way CSipSimple crash on Samsung Galaxy i7500 with Android 1.6 after
I add account. On restart it crash immediately. So only what I can do is
uninstall and install again.</p>

<p>For CSipSimple, you're right, this use case (android version upgrade) that is not yet
managed. (It's a known issue - I've to do things by an optimized way in order to not
affect starting performances)
For now, the only way to get thing fixed is to uninstall and reinstall the application.
Let me know if it doesn't work after uninstall/reinstall (in this case, use of
MediaLibGet will be needed, else it only means that application previously tried to
use the 1.5 lib while your phone now need 1.6 lib)</p>

<p>I'll try to fix it as soon as possible (probably in next build).
Many thanks for the report.</p></markdown-widget>

If you have some skills with the android SDK, a good idea could be to send me 
/system/lib/libmedia.so
/system/lib/libcutils.so
/system/lib/libutils.so
(using "adb pull /system/lib/libmedia.so ./")</p>

<p>With theses files i'll be able to make a build really quickly for your phone.
And by the end of the day I'll be able to provide you an .apk with bundlized native
library (and also latests changes from the trunk ;) )</p>

<p>(in fact the aim of MediaLibGet is to send theses files to me by email, and to give
me some fields os java constants ( in android.os.Build.* ) (this last step is only
needed for json manifest to enable other users to automatically download the good
library).</p></markdown-widget>

No, I am not using GAOSP.
My phone was in service due to some connectivity issues, I had very low signal and
often without signal (2G and 3G). So, in Samsung service in Croatia they told me the
problem was solved by putting new firmware. Weird, but true, the networking problem
is solved. 
I know that 1.5 is last official from Samsung, so I was also suprised having 1.6 now.
I am also suprised how much application have problems now.
It prints:
Model number: galaxy

<p>I attach two builds :
the first one with an experimental build option (it seems to works with my archos). 
It doesn't use your libs : but generics ones : I'm trying to link with another kind
of dynamic linking.</p>

<p>the other one is built with your libs and should works.</p>

<p>Before each install, you'll need to uninstall the application. (A good idea could be
also to reboot the phone since I suspect android to cache dynamic libs sometimes).</p>

<p>It would be cool if you can say me if the first build (CSipSimple_experimental.apk)
works for you. I'm most confident with the second one (CSipSimple_i7500-4) but if the
first works it will be a really good news for me :).</p></markdown-widget>

Before I had crash after I returned from creating account.
Outgoing call established. Audio works to both sides !
There are some issues with handup. Two times I had notification that I am in call and
I cannot do hangup. But, guess this is not what I am testing...
Also, I noticed once that it made outgoing call when I was on EDGE network, which
does not work well here.
On incoming call application crash, so I pressed force close.
Now have to pack for tomorrow trip, hopefully tomorrow I'll find some time to test
i7500 version.
In principle, experimental version works on my phone, with some problems I explained.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>That's a good news if it doesn't crash at start time. 
I think that the i7500 version will not work better regarding the bug you mentioned.
There is some known issues (as you described) for low bandwidth connections.
My tests shown that if application fail to handle properly the hangup of a call, the
next call will make the application crash. So I don't think that the crash you get is
due to the fact it's an incoming call but to the fact it's a call just after a
"silent" bug.
A workaround is to kill the application (using astro for example) and restart it.
But i'm working on the problem.</p>

<p>I leave the bug open for the issue with MediaGetLib and the upgrade android version
issue.</p>

<p>P.S. : the builds I give to you are based on the last trunk (I'm implementing the
native dialer integration but it's not yet functional).</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Can you protect client to be registered on EDGE network ?</p>

<p>Otherwise, sound with CSIPSimple is much better then aSIP and SIPDroid that I used
before on Android 1.5.. Don't know if thats due to fixes in firmware related to my
bad connection or due to your software.
By the way, both aSIP and SIPDroid does not work now on 1.6.
Congratulation. If you need me for any testing I am here to help.
By the way I was SIP developer for few years on PoC and VCC projects, mostly working
on SIP stack. 2 months ago I changed job, but there is still something in my head ;)</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Ok for incoming calls, i'll try to reproduce on my htc magic (also on 1.6) with
latest libs.</p>

<p>I use a native library as SIP stack (SipDroid for example use java SIP stack).
So sound quality is better (and battery consumption lower). Besides all codecs
supported by pjsip can be supported by this application.
I suspect there is another application available on android market which use a native
sip stack (the same that I use : pjsip) : SipAgent. 
If they really use the same stack that I use, (i've seen relevant logs from pjsip
using their app), they don't respect the licence of pjsip as far as I know (pjsip is
under GPLv2 - with a dual licence but pjsip author seems to not be aware of their use).</p>

<p>For EDGE, I can implement this option (and also an option to choose minimal signal
strength). (For now i've just implemented a minimal 3G option for legal purpose in
France (some carriers doesn't allow to use VoIP on their network)).</p>
