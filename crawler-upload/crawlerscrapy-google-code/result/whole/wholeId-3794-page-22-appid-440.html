<p># First create the wizard with the Optimus wizard (if not already done).

<p># Edit the account, and in proxy field (the latest one), change it from asbg.sip.optimus.pt to asbg.sip.optimus.pt;hide

I'm on a 3g network, could that be the cause? In any case, I also have configured a VoipBusterPro account and it works with no problem, so I assume my 3g network does not block the SIP protocol.</p>

<p>On the instructions I don't see anything related to the "famous" user-gent that Optimus requires. I assume this is taken care of by using the Optimus Wizard. Is this correct? And when we use the Advanced Wizard, won't this "invisible" field be overwritten?</p>

<p>Uninstall and install again csipsimple from google play.</p>

<p>Don´t change anything except:
- Create account with optimus wizard;
- Change to Advanced wizard.
- Put this info - server (sip.optimus.pt; user: 351youroptimusnumber (without +); password (please remember you password, installing optimus webphone in windows before); proxy: asbg.sip.optimus.pt;hide</p>

The password to be used with the SIP client is not the same as the one used on the Optimus Client site. In order to get a password for the Optimus softPhone (Optimus SIP Client), one must first register its number on their website ( <a href="http://tag.optimus.pt/Servicos/ActivarWebphone.jsp">http://tag.optimus.pt/Servicos/ActivarWebphone.jsp</a> )and then get an SMS with the SIP password. I guess this is the step I was missing. Even though I had my number already registered, I was trying to use the normal client website password.</p>

<p>I will later test this again since (again) I don't have my Optimus phone with me now to get the SMS with the new password.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your help.
Hope this helps new users as well.</p>

My csipSimple has sucessfully registered with Optimus, and I can make calls as if I was on my phone.
However, I cannot receive any calls. If the original phone is off, the call is not being diverted to SIP, although it says it is registered!
Any special "config item" that tells Optimus to send the calls to SIP?
Anyone with this issue?

I'm trying to create a sip trunk to my Asterisk. I've been monitoring all the traffic in wireshark. One thing i'm shure. From x to x minutes (wich i couldn't count right) the TagWebphone, send's the protocol Keep Alive, to tell the server that the program is online. I think if you try in expertise mode, if there is any option. I'm not shure, but i'm quite certain that is an option keep alive on advanced options.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I am the one that gave the Dev's my account to fix CsipSimple for Optimus in August 2012... The Dev (Regis) was very helpful and with my tests, and my account he was able to fix the client for making calls. (I moved to London in July and used Webphone upto 2 months ago to call to Portugal for free using the Sonae TAG Tariff). 
Perhaps someone can lend an account for Regis or some other developer to use wireshark on the windows version and see if they can tweak csip for android?</p>

<p>Cumprimentos / Regards,
Erick</p></markdown-widget>
