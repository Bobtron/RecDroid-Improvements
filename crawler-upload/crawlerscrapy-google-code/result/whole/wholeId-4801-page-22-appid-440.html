<p>The way around it is to either rely on a disclaimer telling the user its up to him or her and then hope no lawyer comes calling... the other way would be to have a market version with a pricetag covering the patent fee. This might not actually be such a bad idea but it would require a license deal from someplace other the sipro since they charge some ridiculous initial amount just to sign up. Maybe something like <a href="http://www.synapseglobal.com/g729_codec_license.html">http://www.synapseglobal.com/g729_codec_license.html</a>
But I guess that begs the question if anyone would actually pay 10-15 bucks to get a version containing G729...</p></markdown-widget>

He (and I) think that just including his code will be enough to support g729. I'll probably try it today :)</p>

<p>For the license part.... it's more complicated. <br>
I agree with micheal's comment and that's also what Samuel explained to me. 
Thanks a lot micheal for the SynapseGlobal link. I didn't know that there where retailers that allow a per license purchase. Really interesting !! It could be easier to manage than the sipro solution that afraid me a lot !!!</p>

<p>In the case I get a solution to manage the license, the best solution is to provide a plugin app on the market that provide an updated version of the dynamic library. Some changes has to be done in the update process but that was already planned.</p>

<p>This method will sip providers to provide their own application that relies on CSipSimple and include a g729 library if they already pay fees for their users.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Thanks to the very great support from Samuel (author of Siphon), I get something that build.</p>

<p>There is one thing I miss to be able to test... Allow local accounts (because all my registrar rewrite invite offers and doesn't allow g729 :D ).
I'm pretty confident in the fact that it will work, but I don't know what will be the performances.
In fact, for the Iphone version, it was possible to use assembler code, but for android, since we commonly use a aebi assembler, instructions are not the same, so I fall back to generic code. Less efficient but that build within the NDK.</p>

<p>For now, my priority is to implement filters and rewriting rules for native dialer intergration. But I continue this task in background.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>So after many tests (there is still bugs with the codec priority management), my calls between a HTC Sapphire (Magic / G2) and Nexus One using G729. (Both handset use wifi)</p>

<p>Result is pretty good. Latency is really low. Sometimes (probably due to VAD) I get some choppy sound on the G2 but sound is clear on Nexus One.</p>

<p>So it's worth to be continued. For now what I did is just unreleasable : I made code to allow compilation at midnight... But I'll try to do something more clean, and contribute it back to Samuel's Siphon project once it will be enough clean. And of course it will be available on my repo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'll get more information about how to solve this licensing issue. SynapseGlobal sounds a good solution, but give license for special implementation (such as Asterisk's one). And there is maybe a little trick with the fact that a exception to GPL has to be added in code license to allow the <em>distribution</em> with the G729 license.</p></markdown-widget>

So distributing it encouraging it's usage without paying the license could be attacked.
So usually what is done is :
 * Either your sip provider give you the app with G729 (they already pay for G729 channels usage)
 * Or if it's an app that is generic, it is distributed included the g729 licensing fee.</p>

<p>But well, I'm about to find a good way to distribute the plugin with g729. Just be patient... It took time to convince guys I'm talking to to distribute it...
Once there will be a way for users to get the app + the licensing fee, I'll be free to distribute my source code without any risk.
So just be patient guys ;)... You'll probably have to pay for the fee (maybe less than the g729 fee if I can convince guys I'm talking to), OR, get the plugin to the app distributed by another sip provider for free if they already pay for their users, OR, build the app by your own means and use it for tests (or for an usage in which you are sure somebody has pay the license usage for you). </p></markdown-widget>

There is an implementation from Nokia (not absolutely sure that's nokia, but a big device manufacturer), that support fixed point. But that's not opensource. If you can find an opensource and gpl compatible implementation of iLBC, I can try to port it. But for now AFAIK, the only one is floating point (and without any build option to support fix point).
However maybe something could be tried on some armv6 devices that actually support floating points. The tricky thing is that the android NDK disable floating point for armv6 but some devices actually support it. So maybe the floating point implementation could be built on armv6 but will not be portable.</p></markdown-widget>

My hope was that the NDK could build for armv6 with vfp (FPU) that seems the most popular processor.
But it seems not a good idea for portability, if you can not produce a 'Universal' apk as RockPlayer (a video player on the market).
Looking at the link to the apk <a href="http://updates.anplayer.com/rockplayer/">http://updates.anplayer.com/rockplayer/</a> they
seem to distribute in a single apk three .so build.
But maybe I do not know what I'm saying. I do not know the NDK and more</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>My distribution mode of apk are much more clever than universal package :</p>

<p>The apk doesn't contains the library it the library is retrieved by the device at first run. So it's really not a problem for me to distribute some custom lib optimized for some device. (Even better, I can produce a lib by device, at the first step of the project I did that cause I used private API).
So I can do almost everything I want with my modified version of the NDK and my distribution mode (I'm able to support armv4t with the same apk available on the android market... which is not the case of most of the android apps). The other good side of my method is that the distributed apk is not an heavy package with a lot of native lib versions.</p>

<p>The biggest deal is to detect if the CPU will support or not floating point. And that could be really tricky ! In the android API we have only the information about the thumb support version (which is not always relevant - for example armv4t devices). 
However I can divert the library downloaded at first run and update according to the device name for example or anything available on the android API.
That was the sens of my last remark. If I do a custom build for armv6 with vfp, it will not be portable to all devices as it. I'll add to populate my manifest with devices that actually support vfp.</p></markdown-widget>

Btw, you can force the installation of a bundled apk using 0.00-16-00 (different from 0.00-16 and market version that get back the native part of the application on the web). 
g729 should appear in Settings &gt; media &gt; Codecs (it's the last entry). Long press on the codec, choose activate, read the disclamer, press OK.
You can drag and drop it on the top of the list to announce that's your preferred codec.</p>

If it's a g729 license directly yes you can (I mean if they retail to you the right to establish a g729 channel). 
If it's a license that allow you to use g729 <em>only</em> using their application, no you are not allowed.</p>

<p>Ask them :) - and if valid you can report it here, I think that it could be interesting for other users.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>I need some indications regarding the use of G729 codec on sipsimple.</p>

<p>I configured csipsimple to use my sipsorcery account and I would activate G729 codec support but I don't know if all sip providers configured on my sipsorcery account already pay licenses fees for that codec.</p>

<p>If I want to buy one license to use it with csipsimple as stated above is the following link right to buy a proper type of license? (or is it only for Asterisk?)
<a href="http://store.digium.com/productview.php?product_code=G729CODEC">http://store.digium.com/productview.php?product_code=G729CODEC</a></p>

<p>If it's right is required any further action to properly register the license bought with my csipsimple after the purchase or I'm just finished after activating it in the codec menu?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your support</p>

<p>gabriele</p></markdown-widget>

<p>But the same which i said previously, in other thread. First it doesn't make sense to purchase, neither activate you codec if your service provider don't have that codec in service. So first contact your provider to verify if they have it, and if there license cover multichannel, if yes, it's enough that you just activate it in your client, the server license are available to cover your client.</p></markdown-widget>
