  -- I expect phone sounds to return to wherever they were set before the call</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>I'm very impressed with the progress on CSIPsimple over the past year.
On my old Droid 1 running Cyanogen 7.1, it's working great, aside from this issue.
(I do need to prevent the phone from sleeping during a call, but that's no big deal)</p>

<p>Like many others, I have configured Google Voice to ring both my SIP and Cellular numbers.  So, I'm getting bitten by the bug described in  Issue 1190 .
However, I don't consider going back to a two year old version as a viable work around.  The current version has much better echo cancellation and audio quality in general.</p>

<p>I've read on the CSIPsimple site that the purpose of switching on "silent" mode during a SIP call is to avoid "exploding" one's ears should a cellular call come through.  Could either of the following be implemented instead:</p>

<p>1)  Switch on silent mode only after the SIP call is actually answered.  Switch off silent mode when the SIP call ends for any reason or when speakerphone is enabled during a SIP call.  This should be enough to protect against exploding ear drums without affecting those of us using Google Voice to redirect calls.  The key is to leave sound settings unchanged until you really have a SIP call in progress with audio routed out the earpiece.</p>

<p>And/Or...</p>

<p>2)  Add (yet another) configuration option to completely disable the switching on or off of silent mode.  This would likely be easiest.  Bear in mind that many phones actually use a different speaker for ringtones than the earpiece.  A ring with the phone to one's ear would not be deafening, only unpleasent.</p>

<p>One thing I still don't understand is why the phone does not at least vibrate on the incoming cellular call after CSIPsimple enables silent mode, even if I have the Android sound option ticked to "vibrate on silent" or "vibrate always".  Can anyone explain this?</p></markdown-widget>

<p>There is a robust saving of the fact the app changes something in ringer mode and restore it if you restart the app later.
Now the app only changes to silent mode if there is an incoming gsm call while you are in sip call (to avoid your ear to explode). During the sip call you'll not see that the state is changed else.
There is now a call waiting tone that is produced in audio band to announce about a waiting call.
This will work for a waiting gsm call while in sip call but also should work for a waiting sip call while in gsm call.

You are doing some very nice work with the UI.  Congratulations on that.  However...
The ringer silencing rules you have implemented still are not appropriate for use with Google Voice.  You state,
  "the app only changes to silent mode if there is an incoming gsm call while you are in sip call"
But you define "in a sip call" to include the case where the sip call is ringing while a gsm call comes in.
Every call to my Google Voice number rings both my phone's GSM (actually CDMA) plus my SIP number.  Since my phone has no mobile data plan, it receives SIP calls only when it is connected to the net via WiFi.  Google Voice ensures I get the call regardless, by ringing both the Mobile and SIP numbers simultaneously.</p>

<p>But, when I have WiFi, CSIPsimple's silencing causes the phone to ring exactly once, then the phone goes silent.  So, if I don't hear that single ring, I miss the call.
I think you could correct this by silencing the ringer only after a SIP call is accepted.  Either that, or provide a configuration option to disable ringer silencing.</p>

<p>Another issue is that the June 10th version appears to be incompatible with both the Google Voice callback apps in the Android Market. The older GVoice Callback app crashes.   The newer Voice+ app places call back, however, after you hang up, a prompt screen appears asking whether you want to use the Mobile or SIP service to place the original call (again).  Neither of these problems exist with the released version.  (of November 2011)</p></markdown-widget>
