                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well two points here :).</p>

<p>First point about contact. What you see in 0.00-15-13 is an integration to phone contacts that is really simple on my side. I did it cause many users cried about that but that's not the approach I'd like users to use. There is another approach that is much more user friendly. This approach introduced recently, requires the phone to use standard android mechanism. I guess Motorola has it's own contact app (with Blur) that is not a standard contact application.</p>

<p>However, again, there is a really really more powerful way to use the app : just read this : 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ#There_is_no_contact_list">http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/wiki/FAQ#There_is_no_contact_list</a></p>

<p>In fact, CSipSimple is integrated to the entire call system. And if you have not disabled the android integration in settings and if there is not other app (3cxphone....) that does crappy things with native tel uris, when you make a call from anywhere in any android application, you should be asked if you want to use SIP (and which account) or GSM. (And there is also a powerful rewriting and filtering engine in csipsimple)</p>

<p>Well, second point 3cxphone.... 3cxphone relies on exactly the same opensource sip stack that csipsimple (pjsip, it's a library that allow to to SIP).
The difference is that 3cx is closed source application while csipsimple is opensource and I put the focus on the user interface. 
So many consequences to that :
* You can't run 3cx and csipsimple at the same time on a phone else you'll have conflicts and one of the two will not run properly ! (unless you known exactly how to configure each one, but that's pretty complicated). So I'd advise to simply have no other SIP application running if you are using csipsimple (as csipsimple allow multiple accounts configuration should not be so hard to do ;) ).
* If an account works with 3cx, it should also works with csipsimple ! It's only a matter of configuration then and you should read the first entry of the FAQ since it's a frequently encountered issue in 3G (you should also check that you've activated the I'm allowed in 3g checkbox).</p>

<p>For the deprecated contact integration that I recently introduced and is not compatible with motorola blur, I'll try to have a closer look, but again it's not the nicer way to access your contact and make call. The approach of other apps is to make you go inside the app to access your contacts, my approach is to say you, continue to use contacts as you do previously with gsm, and when you'll make the call the app will start and ask you if you want to use gsm or sip (and this behavior is customizable with filters and rewriting rules engine).</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your detailed explanations. I have removed 3cxphone from my phone. Let me see how my specific SIP account works. I have used basic option to add this account but I need to add following additional information. </p>

<p>Realm 1
DTMF Setting : 2833
Inband DTMF : Send DTMF SIP Info
SIP Port: 8088
RTP Port: 60000</p>

<p>STUN Setting
STUN: Off
STUN Server: stun.xten.com
STUN Port: 3478</p>

<p>How Can I do this configuration ?</p>

<p>Secondly I have not disabled the android integration in CSipSimple settings and now there are only two applications 1. CSipSimple and 2. Skype. When I make a call as you told I should be asked if you want to use SIP (and which account) or GSM. I am getting two options i.e. Dialer and Skype but when I select Dialer, I get only SIP accounts options and no GSM option.</p>

<p>Customizable filters and rewriting rules are excellent add-ons to the application.</p>

<p>Please let me know about above issues.</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Well, 
As for settings :
realm : you can just ignore that (the default wildcard of basic account wizard should be good enough).
For DTMF, there is the option in Settings &gt; Media &gt; DTMF Mode (if you are using a latest build dev available on download section).
SIP Port : well, here I don't know what 3CX map on this option but if that's mapped to the remote port of your remote account this should be added in the account settings : In basic wizard creation, on the Server field, just type yourservername:8088 . (You'll quickly see if it doesn't registers it means that 3CX map this option to the local binding port, and it's not really important to change it but you can do it in Settings &gt; Network &gt; UDP Port, you can also change RTP port here).</p>

<p>For STUN as it's turned off on your configuration, you can turn it off in csipsimple also, but to be sure you'll not encounter issues with incoming voice I'd advise you to keep it on unless your sip server is a server in your own local network.</p>

<p>For the second point, I understand now why you didn't use the integration ;). Actually it should allow you to choose for GSM unless csipsimple detect nothing on the phone can manage GSM calls... but I think here again Motorala did something not standard about "tel:" handling so that CSipSimple is lost. I'll add an option to ignore what I detect and force to allow you to choose GSM (I did this detection cause some android devices such as tablets doesn't support GSM calls ;) ).</p>

<p>As for Skype choice, I think that the best solution would be that I provide in choice an entry to redirect call to skype. BTW, you could tick the always use 'CSipSimple' in the first popup and then choose between SIP, Skype and GSM.
I've to check that skype provide an api that allow that, but technically I think that's possible, and that's probably the better solution in term of user experience.</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>I was maybe not clear in my last comment about dialer integration.</p>

<p>In fact the first popup you get is an android popup that simply ask you which application should handle tel:XXXX uris. I don't know exactly where Skype plugs it's integration but if you get the choice between dialer and skype, they probably did a really really crappy thing integrating themself in a private api before everything (which is a really bad idea cause it's a not supported android API).
Well that said, you may first get popup that ask you what application you want to choose to handle the tel action. In theory in this first popup which is managed by the system (and not by any application), you should be able to tick an "always use" checkbox, meaning that each future action should be handled by one application.</p>

<p>For now, as csipsimple doesn't support skype choice, and seems to have a bug with gsm choice on your phone, indeed that's a bad idea to choose always use csipsimple.
But if I solve the two problems (gsm first and skype then), should be the choice that will provide you the best user experience.</p>

<p>I'll try to search over the web to find out why I get a bug on motorola with my GSM detection and keep you in touch about my progress on this point.</p></markdown-widget>

1. Presently getting two option for making call after selecting contact 'Dialer and SkypeOut' Feature for GSM may be added here.
2. After selecting Dialer I get option of all SIP clients. Here 'USE GSM' may be added which will use SIM for making calls.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>-&gt; I changed the way I detect the native dialer.</p>

<p>Now I should detect more reliably :
GSM and also.... Skype !! 
So you should be now able to tick the always use dialer (and remove this crappy integration from skype).</p>

<p>You can also use CSipSimple Filters feature on GSM and on Skype too !! To automatically apply rules to outgoing calls.</p>

<p>I've done the integration back to skype. It's not documented by skype and is a hack I manually do. So if for some phone numbers it doesn't work properly, the first people to cry to is Skype (cause they do not provide anyway for other apps to use their app).</p></markdown-widget>
