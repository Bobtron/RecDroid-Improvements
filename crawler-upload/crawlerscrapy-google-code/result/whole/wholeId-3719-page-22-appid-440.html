This problem affects the nightlies r906 to r925, ginger.  After installing any of these, outbound calls on mobile network no longer connect.  Registration is fine.  Incoming calls are fine.  Calls on wifi both out and in are fine.  The market version is fine both out and in, on both mobile and wifi.</p>

<p>I have already sent logs collected on r925.</p>

<p>I am using Nexus One on 2.3.4 GRJ22.  Had no problem with the nightlies before r906.</p></markdown-widget>

<a href="http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/">http://nightlies.csipsimple.com/trunk/</a></p>

<p>I think it was due to too big udp packet that get dropped by network in the middle.
Network packets get increased when the app supports more codecs. And some where added around r898. 
Now in latest nightlies I try to set by default as less codec as possible enabled. So that UDP packets remains short and that strict networks keep transmitting it.</p>

<p>If you experiment problems with latest nightlies, could be interesting to leave only 1 codec (pcmu or pcma for example) enabled, to see if it helps.</p></markdown-widget>

<p>An ignorant question.  You suggest that the problem with r906 ~ r948, which affected outgoing calls only, was caused by too big udp packets.  Is this something that would not affect incoming calls?</p>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>Yes in this case, incoming call are not impacted.
It's due to how sip works :</p>

<p>When you make an outgoing call, your side (csipsimple) will announce to remote side the codecs it supports. In case of csipsimple it can be big because many codecs are supported. 
I try now to activate as less as possible, and leave then users compare with codecs supported by their provider to select only the best regarding their needs. But was not the case previously : I naively allowed all supported codecs.</p>

<p>On the other side, when you have an incoming call, it's the other side that propose possible codecs. Usually there is only a little list of codecs, because sip providers often only send "best" codecs for their needs and limited by their server capabilities. Then, CSipSimple will pick in this list only one codec, and reply with only this codec. So this packet will be very small.</p>

<p>That's why it's not a symmetric behavior. 
Besides it depends a lot on router in the middle, and mobile carrier are now known to set this value to a small one to reduce their network load.
That's why now, when I see a problem with only outgoing on mobile network or limited network, I often think about this problem.</p>

<p>There is several ways to fix it. One is to reduce codecs list announced by CSipSimple. CSipSimple also support a "Compact header" + "Compact SDP" feature (known as "Compact SIP" in network settings), that also significantly decrease packet size. But it has to be supported by SIP provider. That's why it's not activated by default. Another solution is to switch to TCP transport (which has almost no limit on packet size), but, also, it has to be properly supported by SIP provider.</p>

<p>I understood all of that after a lot of tests, and didn't update this issue just after understanding that. So my apologizes for the big delay to treat the issue.
And thanks for reporting the issue with other issues on the subject it helped me to ring a bell on how to reproduce this kind of problem.</p></markdown-widget>
