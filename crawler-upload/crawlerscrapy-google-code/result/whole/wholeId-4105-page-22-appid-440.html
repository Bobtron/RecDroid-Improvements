<p>I really like cSIPsimple.
I like the UI, like the fast development cycle, and who it is meant to just work, taking away the stuff the user doesnt need.</p>

<p>Also really like the UI, when compared to sipdroid.</p>

<p>but no mater how much I like CSS, when compared to sipdroid on what both apps are meant to do (making SIP/VoIP) calls, sipdroid wins. Always!</p>

<p>I've setup 3 type of accounts (12voip.com, ekiga, portuguese ISP) on my test devices (HTC Magic running CM6.1, HTC Desire HD running CM7).
Two of those accounts it works fine while making calls with sipdroid. But with CSS i have FCs, fail to connects, timeouts, etc.</p>

<p>I've open this bug, so we can track on how to improve cSIPsimple for it to work, cause I would like to promote more this fantastic app.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p></markdown-widget>

<p>Well I'll never update such an issue :)... It's not enough specific to be able to say "it's closed / it's still open"
Under my configuration, csipsimple works much better than SipDroid.... Performance is linked to configuration/sip provider/network/ROM etc. </p>

<p>So as nobody will update this issue I close it.</p>

<p>Besides, CSipSimple is a true opensource project. I mean that I don't fight against other projects. As soon as I get something useful for other opensource projects I share it. I did for the Samsung galaxy S audio driver support, and I'll do if I had other occasions to.</p>

<p>If you like CSipSimple and the way it's developped, the spirit of the project is to contribute to it. 
You can either write docs, test code, report complete logs on Force closes (I guess that's not force close but ANR your get).... or ... contribute the source code.... I do that only on my free time, night and holidays.... SipDroid is developped by pbxes.org on their work time... so logically if nobody else contribute to the project it will not be "the best" program.
Fortunately, some sip providers start to produce effort to contribute the code. So the project will probably evolve in the future.</p>

<p>Besides I don't force nobody to use the app. 
If you consider Sipdroid is better for your needs, feel free to use sipdroid. Linphone or imsdroid are also very good projects that your should try.</p>

<p>Some users consider that's "a professional" app. But they should not... that's an home made app. And if not pleased with that :
* contribute to improve it (you'll be welcome)
* don't use it if you don't want to contribute</p></markdown-widget>

<p>You have CM7 on a desire HD. I suspect CM7 to not be compliant with the full android 2.3 cause of the bad of google.</p>

<p>There is something called PSP behavior that link the wifi card speed of packet reception with the fact the screen is on or off.
However in android 2.3 there is a programatic way to fix this problem. Previously there where a workaround (keep awake while in call), that forced the screen to remain on for some devices (HTC desire hd included).
But with android 2.3 assuming all ROM will implement the new option to lock wifi even if screen goes off, I disabled the workaround.</p>

<p>I think that CM7 does not support it fully yet. Cause of the fact :
* Google has not announced that officially while it's actually in the source code
* HTC has not released drivers for the wifi chipset to allow to manage this problem.</p>

<p>Maybe worth to give the information to CM7 developpers.
You should link this android issue : 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9781">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9781</a></p>

<p>My last comment explain exactly the change made in gingerbread and that I early adopt cause it worked great on Nexus S.</p>

<p>If that's what you experiment... I understand that you think that CSipSimple call quality is awful, and that it is unstable... but if you try with screen always on, or if you can get a CM7 build with PSP mode disabled or with the support of the new wifi lock (or a CM6 build that is in android &lt; 2.3, and so where I apply the keep awake while in call workaround), you'll see that it has nothing to do with what you are currently experimenting. :)</p></markdown-widget>

                <markdown-widget text="comment.content" class="markdown"><p>CM7 does support it.  There's no difference between CM7 and stock Android 2.3 in this respect.  The new lock option is implemented by passing a generic power mode option to the driver via wpa_supplicant.  The effect this has depends on the driver and chipset.  So far the only driver/chipset that I know for certain has the PSP problem is bcm4329, and for bcm4329 in CM7, this power mode option does work and does solve the problem.  The Desire HD uses bcm4329.  Verifying that it works as expected by trying with and without "Keep awake while on call" is still a good idea, of course.</p></markdown-widget>
